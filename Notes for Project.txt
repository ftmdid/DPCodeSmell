First Step: 
Run Downloads class: 
1.downloadGitHubPythonProject is for to download the project (project in the configInfo.yml file)
	If you want to run a different url, you may need to change the url on the FileOperations.getGitHubURL method!
downloadCommits: this is to download the commits on the open source project
	You don't need to make a call to this method because downloadModifiedPythonFiles calls it. 
2.downloadModifiedPythonFiles: this is to download the modified python files(not test files)
3.downloadIssuesFromIssueTrackingSystem: this is to download the issues from issue tracking system
	projectUrl="https://api.github.com/repos/django/django/issues?state=closed&page=&per_page=100" for django
		there are 133 pages in total for django
	projectUrl="https://api.github.com/repos/numpy/numpy/issues?state=closed&page=&per_page=100" for numpy
		there are 139 pages in total for numpy
	projectUrl="https://api.github.com/repos/keras-team/keras/issues?state=closed&page=&per_page=100" for keras-team/keras/
		there are 111 pages in total for keras-team
	projectUrl="https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/models/issues?state=closed&page=83&per_page=100"
		there are 83 pages in total for tensorflow
	projectUrl="https://api.github.com/repos/zulip/zulip/issues?state=closed&page=83&per_page=100"
		there are 148 pages in total for zulip
	projectUrl= "https://api.github.com/repos/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues?state=closed&page=&per_page=100"
		there are 164 pages in total for scikit-learn
	numberOfPages=1 # you can learn how many pages are there on the project by typing the project url to address 
	bar and see if with page=numberOfPages return empty list or not 
	You need to make changes on some lines:
		url= url[:66]+str(j)+url[66:] #numpy
		url= url[:68]+str(j)+url[68:]#django
		url= url[:71]+str(j)+url[71:] #Keras-team
		url= url[:72]+str(j)+url[72:] #models
		url= url[:66]+str(j)+url[66:] #zulip
		url= url[:80]+str(j)+url[80:] #scikit-learn
		you need to use url1 for numpy and url2 for django
	Also, github does not allow to download all issues at once. Therefore, you need to start with lower total pages
	when calling the function. At first, the loop in line 92 of Downloads.downloadIssuesFromIssueTrackingSystem() method
	starts from 1 till the numberOfPages in total. However, after some pages, it throws error. That's why the url and page
	number is printed on the console. You need to check at what number the method throws error, next time, the loop in line 92
	should start from that number like range(1,42), range(42, 80),....range(100, 134) etc.
To download, only the step 1, 2 and 3 should be called!


Second Step: 
Run Analysis class:
makeSemanticAndSyntacticAnalysis: this runs :
	makeSemanticAnalysis() : is for calculateSimiliaritiesBetweenIssueAndCommits() 
	makeSyntacticSubjectAnalysis(): is for isBugNumber(), isKeywords(), isPlainNumber() and isWordAlphaNum() methods to 
									make syntactic analysis
	and writes into util/Analysis/SemanticVsSyntacticAnalysis.csv file


ThirdStep:
At this step, you need to run checkForRelation method. This is to check the smells relation with issues!






!There was a problem with models project of two commit numbers: 451906e4 and a5304312. They were not being downloaded.
