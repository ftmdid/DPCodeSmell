16497,message_send: Don't allow guests to post in full mem. only streams.,"For streams in which only full members are allowed to post,
we block guest users from posting there.

Guests users were blocked from posting to admin only streams
already. So now, guest users can only post to
STREAM_POST_POLICY_EVERYONE streams.

This is not a new feature but a bugfix which should have
happened when implementing full member stream policy / guest users.

16428,invite: Fix text of submit-invitation button on completion.,"There is a bug in invite flow, where the button text resets
to incorrect text after the invitation process is completed.
This bug is because we are using $().button(""reset"") to
reset the button text, but the data-reset-text attribute of
button is not changed when toggling between multi-use link
invite and email invites.

This bug can be fixed by setting data-reset-text attribute
in a way similar to the way we set data-loading-text attribute
on toggling between multiuse and normal invites.

But according to the bootstrap [docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/migration/#buttons), ""reset"" method was removed
in v4.0.
Though we are not using Bootstrap v4.0 as of now, but it is
good to remove such methods as it will help in future when we
would upgrade to later bootstrap versions.

So instead of fixing this by above mentioned patch, we are
fixing this by removing ""reset"" method and instead using simple
jquery to reset the text and enable the button after the invite
process is completed.

16424,puppeteer: Fix typing issue in settings test.,"The failures saying incorrect password were caused due to
change in focus. Some actual code of ours calls focus on
the modal when opened but puppeteer was starting to type
before this occurs due to which the test was only able
to enter a part of string.

This was happening with change full name too but less
frequently as it's a relatively shorter string.

start typing.

use `.1` to mean logrotate was used.  Also note that these are not all
sequential -- 4, 5, and 6 are mysteriously missing, though they were
used in previous restarts.  This can make it extremely hard to debug

16306,email: Fix race conditions with concurrent ScheduledEmail handling.,"The main race conditions, which actually happened in production was with
concurrent execution of deliver_email and clear_scheduled_emails.
clear_scheduled_emails could delete all email.users in the middle of
deliver_email execution, causing it to pass empty to_user_ids list to
send_email. We mitigate this by getting the list of user ids in a single
query and moving forward with that snapshot, not having to worry about
database data being mutated anymore.

clear_scheduled_emails had potential race conditions with concurrent
execution of itself due to not locking the appropriate rows upon
selecting them for the purpose of potentially deleting them. FOR UPDATE
locks need to be acquired to prevent simultaneous mutation.

Tested manually with some print+sleep debugging to make some races
happen.

As # is the property of browser in the url so i added the next parameter in all the form action to solve this issue.

Now the redirection also works successfully.

The main cause of this issue is not with the next parameter but it's with the url('zerver.views.auth.dev_direct_login') because it adds //#scholarship in the form action which is an invalid url. Therefore after adding `?next=` the redirection works successfully. Also if a next parameter is not present in the url then i have tested this for that also and it work successfully.

16192,queue: Use locking to avoid race conditions in missedmessage_emails.,"This queue had a race condition with creation of another Timer while
maybe_send_batched_emails is still doing its work, which may cause
two or more threads to be running maybe_send_batched_emails
at the same time, mutating the shared data simultaneously.

Another less likely potential race condition was that
maybe_send_batched_emails after sending out its email, can call
ensure_timer(). If the consume function is run simultaneously
in the main thread, it will call ensure_timer() too, which,
given unfortunate timings, might lead to both calls setting a new Timer.

We add locking to the queue to avoid such race conditions.

Tested manually, by print debugging with the following setup:
1. Making handle_missedmessage_emails sleep 2 seconds for each email,
   and changed BATCH_DURATION to 1s to make the queue start working
   right after launching.
2. Putting a bunch of events in the queue.
3. ./manage.py process_queue --queue_name missedmessage_emails
4. Once maybe_send_batched_emails is called and while it's processing
the events, I pushed more events to the queue. That triggers the
consume() function and ensure_timer().

Before implementing the locking mechanism, this causes two threads
to run maybe_send_batched_emails at the same time, mutating each other's
shared data, causing a traceback such as

Exception in thread Thread-3:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""/usr/lib/python3.6/threading.py"", line 916, in _bootstrap_inner

    del self.events_by_recipient[user_profile_id]
KeyError: '5'

With the locking mechanism, things get handled as expected, and
ensure_timer() exits if it can't obtain the lock due to
maybe_send_batched_emails still working.

16183,webhooks/gitlab: Use information about all assignees.,"Previously, the GitLab webhook code, namely the `get_objects_assignee`
method first tried to get a single assignee and if that failed then it
looks for multiple assignees and then it would return the first
assignee that it found (there's actually a code smell here - a loop
which would always return on the first iteration).

Instead, this commit will change that behavior to first check for
multiple assignees first then for a single assignee if we can't find
multiple assignees. Ultimately it will return a list of all of the
assignees (however many that might be [0, n]). This method has then
aptly been renamed to `get_assignees`.

Finally, we tweked the code using this method to always use it's
output as an ""assignees"" parameter to templates (there's also an
assignee parameter which we want to avoid here for consistency).

This gets particularly confusing when the only change is in the assignees (say, from A and B to A and C), but the bot reports no change (only A). I think this may be a problem [here](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/ad8943a64aab3f21ba692fe3842232291e222838/zerver/webhooks/gitlab/view.py#L150):

```python
def get_objects_assignee(payload: Dict[str, Any]) -> Optional[str]:
    assignee_object = payload.get('assignee')
    if assignee_object:
        return assignee_object.get('name')
    else:
        assignee_object = payload.get('assignees')
        if assignee_object:
            for assignee in assignee_object:

```

At least in my MRs, the GitLab response contains both `assignee` and `assignees`, but Zulip takes only the former. It should probably be the other wey around, and it should return all assignees, not just the name of the first one!

16125,"filter: Fix bug of not showing results on using ""has:image"".","There was a bug where filtering using ""has:image"" does not show
any messages, while filtering using ""has:attachments"" includes
messages with images.

This commit fixes the bug by changing message_util.message_has_image
to use 'hasClass' for checking if element with 'message_inline_image'
class exists or not instead of using find.

This change is done because '.find' searches for descendants of the
element, whereas in this case the '.message_inline_image' element is
not a descendant of a element in 'message.content', but it is one of
the elements of 'message.content'.

16109,OpenAPI schema and validation is built on a fundamental misunderstanding of allOf,"The `yamole` library preprocesses our OpenAPI schema by expanding `$ref` (incorrectly: #16106) and then naïvely merging all the objects in an `allOf` array together. This fails to capture the meaning of [`allOf`](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/oneof-anyof-allof-not/) according to the specification.

For example, consider

```yaml
components:
  # …
  schemas:
    # …
    JsonResponse:
      type: object
      additionalProperties: false
      properties:
        result:
          type: string
    JsonSuccess:
      allOf:
        - $ref: ""#/components/schemas/JsonResponse""
        - required:
            - result
            - msg
        - properties:
            result:
              enum:
                - success
            msg:
              type: string
        - example: {""msg"": """", ""result"": ""success""}
```

In order for `{""msg"": """", ""result"": ""success""}` to validate against `JsonSuccess`, it must validate against `JsonSuccess.allOf[0]` and validate against `JsonSuccess.allOf[1]` and validate against `JsonSuccess.allOf[2]` and validate against `JsonSuccess.allOf[3]`. But it does not validate against `JsonSuccess.allOf[0] == JsonResponse` because `JsonResponse` specifies that the object must have a `result` property and no other properties (`additionalProperties: false`).

`yamole`’s merging before validation obscures this failure in a way that’s not supported by the specification: “`allOf` takes an array of object definitions that are used for **independent** validation… To be valid against `allOf`, the data provided by the client must be valid against all of the given subschemas.”

marshalling of Streams and similar data structures where we were
including the Stream object rather than its ID in dictionaries passed
to ujson, and ujson happily wrote that large object dump into the
RealmAuditLog.extra_data field.

This commit includes a migration to fix those corrupted RealmAuditLog
entries, and because the migration loop is the same, also fixes the
format of similar RealmAuditLog entries to be in a more natural format
that doesn't weirdly nest and duplicate the ""property"" field.

See the migration for detailed comments, but this fixes the format of
various RealmAuditLog entries to be in a more intuitive format.

I've tested the code for the migration part manually pretty extensively using both development and
production data, but it's definitely worth a read and probably worth one of you testing as well.

15970,Use 😛 as :P emoticon translation,"#15590 added the (optional) translation of `:P` to `:stuck_out_tongue:`. However, Zulip renders `:stuck_out_tongue:` as [`😝 U+1F61D`](https://emojipedia.org/squinting-face-with-tongue/), while I would expect `:P`/`:p` to render as [`😛 U+1F61B`](https://emojipedia.org/face-with-tongue/) (called `:mischievous:` in Zulip). `U+1F61B` is what gets rendered for `:P`/`:p` on any other platform I am on (e.g. Slack, FB, Hangouts).

I guess https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/32d234ef8ae7421e1c0f1ef7e9b36bf1026967f0 would be a way to fix this, but actually maybe the emoji names for these ones should be changed.

- Canarytokens from canarytokens.org (by Thinkst) and those configurable from the Thinkst product have completely different webhook schemas. The `thinkst` integration now only supports the Thinkst product's webhooks, and the `canarytokens` integration is added for canarytokens.org.
- Various fixes and additions to support all of the data that Thinkst's webhook sends.

This will prevent future occurences of this issue with creating multiple accounts for the same email in one realm, but this won't fix the deployments where this has already happened and are getting exceptions due to this. That should be extremely rare though, sufficiently rare for it to be reasonable to just help out those folks debug and fix the situation on a case-by-case basis rather than trying to come up with some fancy general migration that will handle all possible variants safely without losing meaningful data from the duplicated UserProfiles. So probably it'll be sufficient to, as Tim suggested in a chat, to just put a relevant mention of this in the upgrade notes. Something like:

> Previous versions had a bug which could lead to multiple user accounts being created with the same email address in one realm, corrupting the state of the database. We believe this to be an extremely rare scenario and few, if any, of self-hosted installations will have been affected. This upgrade contains a database migration that will prevent future occurrences of this bug, but the migration will fail if the server has already been affected. If you want to ensure to avoid unexpected downtime due to that, you can run the following code in the Django shell (`/home/zulip/deployments/current/manage.py shell` ):
````
from django.db.models.functions import Lower
UserProfile.objects.all().annotate(email_lower=Lower(""delivery_email"")).values('realm_id', 'email_lower').annotate(Count('id')).filter(id__count__gte=2)
````
> and if it outputs any emails, contact us on chat.zulip.org and we'll help you fix the situation before proceeding with the upgrade.",mateuszmandera,b'area: production bug priority: high size: S',2020-07-15T15:54:26Z,2020-07-15T16:55:18Z
15804,styles: Make focus outline work reliably.,"For a:focus Bootstrap sets the following rules:

    outline: thin dotted #333;
    outline: 5px auto -webkit-focus-ring-color;

Firefox does not know -webkit-focus-ring-color and falls back to the
previous rule, making the outline invisible in darkmode.

Chromium has a bug[1] that makes outline: auto invisible when focussing
elements programmatically (which we do for the up & down arrow keys).

[1]: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1105822

Fixes #15768.

the searchbox/tab_bar to disappear when the searchbox was opened. This
bug was a result of the following changes:
- 4cdd7aed2be34795a1cbd8db84233f70daea7784 accidentally added this line
  as right: 2; instead of right: 2px;
- 46c966576d65eaec0e9a185d62a2082060b129dc fixed this line to be
  right: 2px; but caused the regression.

This commit fixes the bug by deleting this line.

As a part of fixing #15518, this is an improved approach for the issue making the twitter previews behave like our image previews. Overall the experience feels more consistent and the spoiler-preview interaction is fixed as a consequence of the overall change here.

15772,psycopg2.errors.UniqueViolation duplicate key value violates unique constraint,"Hey guys,

might be related to #10579.

* git: 2b95f54593a2d226c25b0a24a4b85a44399c24de (2.1.4)
* two realms
* account `zulip.zerver_userprofile`.`email` are all like `userNN`@domain.tld

When inviting a new user via email clicking the registration url results in http 500 internal server error. As I delegated admin control to non-tech guys I'm unaware what might have happened.

What I see from the database (`zerver_userprofile`) is that there is one email address (`delivery_email`) available in both realms, with `id` being empty (see stack below) in one of the realms (id 2).

```sql
delete from zulip.zerver_userprofile where id = 123;
```

fails with 

```
ERROR:  update or delete on table ""zerver_userprofile"" violates foreign key constraint ""zerver_useractivity_user_profile_id_3f3c3ea8_fk_zerver_us"" on table ""zerver_useractivity""
DETAIL:  Key (id)=(123) is still referenced from table ""zerver_useractivity"".
```

I'm interested in two things:
* You understand the error and can fix its origins.
* I can invite people to the zulip instance again.

Any help greatly appreciated!

15722,popovers: Improve keyboard navigation,"<!-- What's this PR for?  (Just a link to an issue is fine.) -->
Fixes  #15448

**Testing Plan:** <!-- How have you tested? -->
1. Run the server.
2. Clicked different popovers opening buttons/icons
3. Used arrow keys and vim up down keys to navigate.
4. Hit enter key to click on it via keyboard.
5. Also used tab to navigate to next focusable element. (This is browser's handling not out hotkeys)

15721,upgrade: Add management command to fix FTS indexes.,"Fixes #14982.

`update_fts_indexes` is a weird background process that care of index updates on new messages in the background, it doesn't feel right to make it also a command for one-time audit and fix after an upgrade - I think it's more natural to just have a management command for that - especially since the changes to the code of `update_Fts_indexes` that would be needed would make it much less readable.

Doesn't check pgroonga records, as I don't think we're aware of any breakage happening there? And given that I haven't worked with pgroonga, I don't know what such hypothetical breakages would be that we should audit for.

15680,message list: Fix exception re-rendering messages following local echo.,"Fixes #15346.

Step to reproduce:
1. Set 10 secs delay in [`do_send_messages`](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/master/zerver/lib/actions.py#L1365)
2. Update the setTimeout timer to 5000ms from 0 in [`change_message_id`](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/master/static/js/message_list_data.js#L554)
3. [OPTIONAL] Comment out the [re-selection](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/master/static/js/message_list_view.js#L1092).
(The first 2 points are enough to always reproduce this exception.
Added this to test out the other code path which raises the exception,
which isn't necessary, but it is helpful to know when to create the race by scrolling or clicking,
i.e. when the message pointer loses focus. )
4. Send a message to the narrow / all messages, from a user.
5. Using a different user, send a message to the same message list. This message gets locally echoed.
6. Select the locally echoed message. The other users message gets displayed out of order, just below it.
7. Our sent message is received and the message is still selected, thus raising the exception.
(If point 3 was done, then we would have to manually re-select the message).
This PR allows the re-ordering of the message without raising the exception.

15654,stream_edit: Fix scrolling in subscribers list.,"We had a bug in subscribers list, where the scrolling worked only till
first 80 subscribers (which is the initial render count of list_render
widget) in the list even when stream has more subscribers. Ideally
more subscribers should be rendered on scrolling.

This was happening because the scrolling events in list_render.js was
being registered for element with ""subscriber_list_container"" class
instead of the element with ""simplebar-content-wrapper"" class, as
simplebar is added to the element only after it is loaded into the DOM
and we were calling list_render.create before that.

We fix the bug by extracting the code for creating lists to
render_subscribers_list and calling it only after the element is
loaded into DOM, which is done by using "".ready()"" method of jquery.

Fixes #15637.

15595,message_controls: Don't show pencil icon until server ack.,"Previously, this was unconditional wrt local echoe which caused a bug
where by the pencil edit icon was visible first, then got hidden when
the chevron and star became visible.




This commit resolves the above bug, but this area still behaves
slightly weirdly in that, if, within a PM narrow, the user's mouse is
over the spot where the message edit controls will appear after
sending, and then a message is sent by the user, only the chevron ans
star appear at first. On hover exit and reenter, all three controls
reappear, correctly.

Similar to the other ""unless locally echoed"" cases here, this will
probably prevent unexpected bugs caused by eg trying to enter edit
state before the message was received by the server.

But then as I experimented, by manually switching to Night mode, I discovered that your Night mode is also fine:

![Screenshot from 2020-06-24 15-51-58](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/173127/85621462-568eae00-b633-11ea-8ac0-329f7aa6898b.png)

So the problem somehow arises from the combination of 1. using Zulip's automatic color scheme with 2. PopOS ""Dark"" appearance (which you choose in the Settings for the Window Manager, which I assume is gnome... Its possible that my use of Firefox is relevant, I haven't tried other browser yet here.

15554,Code blocks are not very readable in night mode,"When using the night mode color scheme on the desktop client, I find that code blocks are very hard to read. The background of the code block is rendered in white, but the foreground behind the text is dark and has poor contrast with the code. The resulting view is sort of jarring and difficult to read. As an example:

Also note how the list view has the title of the last viewed section and highlights it in the list (which is quite confusing).

With the first commit it looks like this:

15497,"Erroneous ""Your message is outside your current narrow"" notices","I ran into another instance where we displayed the ""Sent! Your message is outside your current narrow."" error message erroneously.  

After some debugging, I figured out the recipe for what happend:
* Send a message to a new topic, but have the server be slow to response (E.g. because you added a `time.sleep(5)` in the send_message_backend function to help reproduce this).
* See the message locally echoed with a floating-point ID like `1234.01`
* The compose box should reopen
* Hit `Ctrl+.` to trigger a renarrow to the current compose location
* We'll enter that view, with the locally echoed message displayed via the `load_local_messages` code path
* We send a request to the server to fetch more messages; this request is done with an `anchor` of the selected message -- which in this case is of course the only message in this view, with ID `1234.01`. 
* This API request gets a 400 error, because floating points aren't allowed in the `GET /messages` API.
* This error leaves us stuck with `fetch_status.has_found_newest = false` and a loading spinner.  

Tagging as a blocker because recent changes make this failure mode much worse than it should be.  I think our fix should have two parts:
* We should ensure the `Your message is outside your current narrow` notice only occurs if the new message actually doesn't match.  Might involve adding a check of this form in the `notifications.js` logic for deciding to trigger this notice
.
```
                if (current_filter && current_filter.can_apply_locally() &&                                     
                    !current_filter.predicate()(msg)) {                                                         
```
* Second, we should fix actual bug here.  I think this is likely as simple as just having the `message_fetch` code round the anchor to an integer with a brief comment about floating point local echo IDs.

15428,"""Active notifications"" that were edited and shouldn't be notifiable","I have two messages on chat.zulip.org with the `active_mobile_push_notification` bit set -- even though I'm fully caught up.

This becomes conspicuous with #15179, which is currently deployed on chat.zulip.org for testing though it's not yet merged. With that PR, I see a red badge reading ""2"" on the Zulip app on the iPhone home screen. This would be a pretty bad experience if I were any normal user -- specifically if I couldn't go look in the server's database to debug.

Both messages are indeed unread. But all the other UserMessage flags are clear -- they're both stream messages, and *don't* have any mention or wildcard-mention flags. With my settings, that should mean they'd never have caused notifications in the first place.

But, both were edited:
* One message originally @-mentioned me, and was ""deleted"", i.e. edited to ""(deleted)"".
* One message originally @-mentioned the `@mobile` group, and... actually it seems to have been edited to a version that *still* says `@*mobile*`. So there may be a second bug there -- it should still have the wildcard-mention flag. Nevertheless, given that it lost that flag, it's an instance of this bug too.

Both were to streams I've muted, so it's natural that they remain unread even though I'm caught up.

The deleted message was from 2020-04, just a couple of months ago; the one with `@*mobile*` was from 2019-01.

We should ensure that when a message is edited so that it no longer should cause a notification:
* a `remove` notification-message is sent to remove the notification;
* the `active_mobile_push_notification` bit is cleared.

We should also likely produce a migration to do this for existing messages, before merging #15179 or deploying on zulip.com. Otherwise anyone with previous messages affected by this bug (and using iOS) will have a bad experience where probably the best outcome is they simply disable Zulip from being able to show a badge count.

These loggers were previously configured in a few lines of global scope code at the top of zerver/decorator.py using `log_to_file` and then stored in global variables.

This, for reasons I'm not entirely certain of, lead to issues where sometimes the loggers would not be configured with the extra handlers added via. `log_to_file` but rather only the loggers specified in the configuration dictionary in computed_settings.py. So by specifying all of the handlers for these loggers in computed_settings.py itself we can both fix this issue and keep our logging configuration cleaner (in just one easy to read dictionary).

Fixes #15391.

15374,Scope problems with loading_newer indicator,"The new loading_newer loading indicators turn out to be buggy, because of the somewhat subtle interaction caused by there being multiple message lists fetching data at a time.  Specifically, if you visit a narrowed view when the ""Home"" view isn't fully caught up, we'll end up showing loading indicators at the bottom of the page, even if the view we're actually looking at is caught up.

The structural problem is that we don't appear to properly scope the loading indicator logic accessed by `load_more` in `message_fetch.js` to only if `current_msg_list` is `home_msg_list`.

```

The bug here is clearly that we are somehow allowing someone to click on the UI elements in this part of the message.  There's two possibilities: This is a message we ourselves sent and we didn't hide this UI properly after the message was processed by the server, or this UI was shown in the first place for a message sent by someone else.  The former is suggested by the fact that the message ID in question was sent by the user who got this error in the cases I've seen.

```
    <div class=""message_failed {{#unless msg.failed_request}}notvisible{{/unless}}"">
        <i class=""fa fa-refresh refresh-failed-message"" data-toggle=""tooltip"" title=""{{t 'Retry' }}"" aria-label=""{{t 'Retry' }}"" role=""button"" tabindex=""0""></i>
        <i class=""fa fa-times-circle remove-failed-message"" aria-hidden=""true"" data-toggle=""tooltip"" title=""{{t 'Cancel' }}""></i>
    </div>
```

This is with the Opera 68 browser, which may very well be relevant.

I certainly find it hard to understand the state machine for how those widgets are cleared, after reading the code, which makes me think it may just be a bit buggy (e.g. the buttons don't hide as soon as they should, or something).  In any case, an attempt to reproduce should start with making the send-message server-side code path return an error.

I should also mention that there's probably an opportunity to improve the code to avoid rendering to the DOM those widgets in messages that the user didn't themself send; we are likely wasting some browser resources in the vast majority of messages from the current model.",timabbott,b'area: compose area: message-editing bug help wanted',2020-06-13T00:37:03Z,2020-07-13T19:29:34Z

The code that's failing is this:

So the bug is most likely that somehow we have two copies of `.emoji-popover-emoji-map` in the DOM.

15347,Corrupted Reactions data model state when using multiple aliases for an emoji code,"We have this exception in our frontend exception logs:

`ERROR: server sent duplicate reactions for user {user_id} (key=unicode_emoji,1f44d)`

Looking at the data in question, we indeed have two near-identical Reaction objects in the database for a given message_id/user_profile_id/emoji_code pair; the only difference is that one is `+1` as `emoji_name` and the other is `thumbs_up`.  

The database currently have this unique constraint on the Reaction model:
`unique_together = (""user_profile"", ""message"", ""emoji_name"")`

I think perhaps the bug is that we should also have this unique constraint:

`unique_together = (""user_profile"", ""message"", ""reaction_type"", ""emoji_code"")`

Tagging as a priority since it's important to having bugs where the database doesn't match the intended data model.

This is clearly the result of a race, since we have this check in the view code:

```

The issue seems to be that in the `echo.process_from_server` code path for that runs after a locally echoed message is received via `server_events`, we try to rerender the message in `home_msg_list`.  Somehow, we're finding that we find the currently selected message needs to be rerendered while doing so (i.e. we'd selected the locally echoed message), but then we're failing to actually select it after doing so.  My guess is this just throws an exception every time.

To try to reproduce this, I'd try adding a 5s delay before calling `send_event` in the `do_send_messages` code path, and then select the locally echoed message, to see if that triggers an exception when the `server_events` code runs.

15340,validate every response in backend tests against OpenAPI schema,"I've been feeling unsatisfied that we have this great logic with `validate_against_openapi_schema` for testing the schema of responses returned by the Zulip server, but we only run it in the OpenAPI tests which generally query each documented endpoint exactly once, rather than in our full suite of correctness tests for the project.  In theory, we could modify the Django test HTTP client via roughly the following code in our `client_get`, `client_post`, etc. wrappers:

``` python
    @instrument_url                                                                                  
    def client_get(self, url: str, info: Dict[str, Any]={}, **kwargs: Any) -> HttpResponse:          
        django_client = self.client  # see WRAPPER_COMMENT                                           
        self.set_http_headers(kwargs)                                                                
        result = django_client.get(url, info, **kwargs)                                              
        if url.startswith(""/json"") or url.startswith(""/api/v1""):
            validate_against_openapi_schema(ujson.loads(result.content),                                 
                                            url.replace(""/json/"", ""/"").replace(""/api/v1/"", ""/""),         
                                            ""get"", str(result.status_code))                              
        return result                                                                                
```

There's a few core problems we'll need to solve:
* Having an easy way to make a broad exclude list so that we can merge the test and the incrementally fix the various classes of issues (undocumented endpoints, etc.).  I'd start with (1) not checking any endpoint that doesn't appear in the OpenAPI file and (2) having a list of endpoints that we just skip, so that we can merge the framework, and then various folks can farm out the effort of debugging specifically why each endpoint is failing one-by-one in smaller PRs.
* Translating syntax for handling parameters that live in the PATH (or maybe changing how those calls are done to pass the `/json/users/{user_id}, user_id=6` not yet substituted, but I think that'd be hard).
* Declaring in some way which schema to match against when there are multiple (or perhaps making `validate_against_openapi_schema` support iterating through the possibilities)

But following that effort, we'll have a really valuable TODO list of places where our API documentation may not match reality, and (given our full test coverage of server-side behavior) ultimately an extremely powerful check that our API documentation fully describes the actual API.

15304,Add Pysa coverage to Zulip,"This PR adds support for [Pysa](https://pyre-check.org/docs/pysa-basics.html), a tool for detecting security issues via static taint flow analysis. This is the tool that was used to detect a number of Zulip security issues, including CVE-2019-19775.

The PR makes a few key changes:
1. Introduces a `.pyre_configuration` file. This provides the necessary configuration information for Pysa to find type stubs, taint information, and the source code.
1. Introduces a dependency on `pyre-check`. This is the package contains Pysa (accessed through the `pyre analyze` command).
1. Introduces `stubs/taint/false_positives.pysa`, a file containing [`Sanitize`](https://pyre-check.org/docs/pysa-basics.html#sanitizers) models used to remove false positive taint flows. 
1. Introduces `mark_sanitized`, an identity function with no runtime effect. It is used inline in some functions to remove false positives.

With the existing sanitizers in place, Pysa currently shows no issues on Zulip (other than in the 5010 category covering UserControlled -> `getattr` flows, which you will likely choose to ignore).

**Testing Plan:**
Ran the following commands:
```
$ cd /srv/zulip
$ pyre analyze --no-verify --save-results-to /srv/zulip
$ sapp analyze taint-output.json
$ sapp explore
```
Observed the results in `sapp explore` to only show issues with code 5010.

Note that because `sapp` is not actually needed nor used in this diff, I did not add a dependency. Additionally, due to a bug in it's dependency setup, installing `pyre-check` is not sufficient for it to run. You will need run this command to install additional packages if you want to run SAPP:
```
pip install click click-log ipython==7.6.1 munch pygments SQLAlchemy ujson~=1.35 xxhash~=1.3.0 prompt-toolkit~=2.0.9
```

**Documentation:**
This section of the Pyre documentation covers Pysa:
https://pyre-check.org/docs/pysa-basics.html

Pysa code lives in this repository:
https://github.com/facebook/pyre-check

A tutorial to learn the basics is accessible here:
https://github.com/facebook/pyre-check/tree/master/pysa_tutorial

on a string, but completely removed the utility of allowed_hosts in
is_safe_url.
This commit fixes up the whole handling of redirect_host more
comprehensively.
We need to support passing redirect_host with a scheme because the
typical usage of this function is something like
get_safe_redirect_to(redirect_to, user_profile.realm.uri)
where user_profile.realm.uri will contain the scheme, and it would be
very messy to require the caller to extract the host. That's why this
should be handled in the function.

15285,Add support for bulk delete_message events,"Now that we're doing things that from a user perspective are bulk-deletions of messages, we need to update the interface for how Zulip's real-time events API notifies clients of message deletions to support bulk updates.  We'll use this in a few places:
* The existing `do_delete_messages`, even in cases where all messages are in the same stream/topic, ends up doing individual events for each message in a giant loop.
* This is a blocker for https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/15277.

What's super tricky about this is that the `delete_message` event format wasn't designed with bulk messages in mind.  So we need to detect which clients support the newer format, using our handy `client_capabilities` feature.  Here's the plan:
* Add a new supported `bulk_message_deletion` client capability to `events_register_backend` and the API documentation, in a first commit.
* pass that property through `do_events_register`.  We may want to do a preparatory refactoring commit to pass the whole `client_capabilities` structure through to `do_events_register` as future-proofing, (replacing the `notification_settings_null` parameter).  We'll ultimate need that to end up in `request_event_queue` and finally being stored on the `ClientDescriptor` object generated created in our events system.
* Then, we migrate the format for `delete_message` events to use a `message_ids` list rather than a `message_id` singleton integer.  For backwards-compatibility, clients without the feature would have a list of events generated for them.

```
    elif event['type'] == ""delete_message"" and len(users) > 0 and isinstance(users[0], dict):        
        # do_delete_messages used to send events with users in dict format {""id"": <int>}             
        # This block is here for compatibility with events in that format still in the queue         
        # at the time of upgrade.                                                                    
        # TODO: Remove this block in release >= 2.3.                                                 
        user_ids = [user['id'] for user in cast(Iterable[Mapping[str, int]], users)]                 
-        process_event(event, user_ids)

def process_deletion_event(event: Mapping[str, Any], users: Iterable[int]) -> None:                           
    for user_profile_id in users:                                                                    
        for client in get_client_descriptors_for_user(user_profile_id):                              
            if not client.accepts_event(event):
                continue
            if client.has_capability(""bulk_message_deletion""):
                client.add_event(event)                                                              
                continue
            for message_id in event['message_ids']:
                compatibility_event = event.copy()
                compatibility_event['message_id'] = message_id
                del compatibility_event['message_ids']
                client.add_event(event)
```

We'll want to push hard on releasing updated apps that support the new `client_capability`, to minimize how often the backwards-compatibility code ever runs.

(And we might want to default all non-ZulipMobile app clients to assume the new capability to avoid accidental use of the old format in the future).",timabbott,b'area: api bug difficult in progress priority: high',2020-06-09T22:44:11Z,2020-06-15T17:55:43Z

because although there is a confirm button, the 'clickoutFiresChanges'

request to edit the stream and, for a reason I wasn't able to discover,
if you hit the confirm button and click outside fast enough, the change
fired by the clickout event sent the old color to the server. It was
fixed by setting the 'clickoutFiresChanges' option to false.

In any case, our data import/export tooling throws this exception for empty streams, and probably we should just remove that check after confirming that we feel it's safe to do so.

15142,"Revert ""buddy list: Adjust sizing calc for narrow mode.""","This reverts commit 9f5725d2659560a15399bf0ff3e64a0dbdb0be94.

I was trying to fix how we display the buddy list in
narrow mode, which was 10px, but my fix ended up making
things worse for regular mode, and somebody reported
a traceback related to this, which I didn't fully research,
but which I suspect is related to some media-query settings
for small screens or due to the put-buddy-list-in-left-pane
setting.  (Basically, `$('#right-sidebar').position()` may
be undefined in some cases, and I wasn't handling that.)

After reverting this, we still have the original
off-by-10px bug that I was trying to fix, but I will
attempt to do that more cleanly in a separate commit.

This should make it so that in normal situations where
the buddy list is in the right sidebar, we will be
able to see the ""Invite more users"" link again.

Fortunally, this regression was only on master for a
couple days, and users could still invite users via
the gear menu.

15139,"presence: Fix ""Last active:"" in buddy list when last presence is idle.","The mechanism of the bug is explained below. To reproduce, just mouseover some of the Idle people on czo, it shows ""Last active: more than 2 weeks ago"", because the latest presence status update of the apps they use is IDLE. We chatted with @showell  and decided to restore the old behavior (explained below too) for now.


Commit message:

Restored old behavior accidentally removed in
https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/1ae07b93d892bbc1a5f939a2a099d5462f7e1970#diff-e353fab8bea58b8746ec68c83aa39b36L48

The server only remembers the most recent presence status update per
device. Meaning that, for instance, if the user only uses one client and
that client's last status update was IDLE, then the server only knows
that, doesn't know anything about the user's last ACTIVE time. Thus the
""active_timestamp"" the server will serve about this user to the webapp
will be ""undefined"".
The old behavior was that for the sake of the ""Last active: x ago""
status in buddy list popover, the latest status timestamp was used,
whether IDLE or ACTIVE.
The change linked about changed that to only pay attention to
ACTIVE. Thus, if the server doesn't remember any ACTIVE statuses, webapp
would show ""Last active: More than 2 weeks ago"", which was incorrect.

We restore the old behavior and further improvements can be made on top
of this.

confusion where charles/maria got repeated
in different tests with different ids.

I also introduce a couple four-digit ids to
try to expose more bugs related to sorting.

Note that it's still easy to keep tests
isolated here, as we have always been able
to cheaply re-initialize `people.js` and then
add individual users back.

There are still some tests where it makes
sense to just declare users locally, especially
if we are mutating their data.

There are a few minor incidental cleanups here,
mostly involving replacing hard coded ids
with things like `maria.user_id`.

15065,"message list: Render new messages only after ""newest"" is found.","Fixes #14017

<!-- What's this PR for?  (Just a link to an issue is fine.) -->


**Testing Plan:** <!-- How have you tested? -->
Tested manually as follows:-

1. set 5 secs delay for [get messages](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/master/zerver/views/messages.py#L804).
2. Also set 10 seconds delay if `query_info['found_newest']` = True in [same view function](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/master/zerver/views/messages.py#L969)
3.  set timeout duration to 500000 in [sent messages](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/master/static/js/sent_messages.js#L113). (not sure if necessary, was getting blueslip warnings about event loop restarting)
4. `./manage.py populate_db -n10000`
5. `./manage.py mark_all_messages_unread`
6. Go to private message narrow
7. send a message to that narrow when all the messages haven't been fetched.
Previously the new message would get temporarily displayed.
Now the new message isn't rendered but is processed. (such as unread count increases)
8. send another message when last batch is being fetched.
This message gets stored in `_newest_items` and after the fetch is complete and the new if condition in `message_list.js` is satisfied, the new message(`_newest_items`) is rendered after the fetched messages(`bottom_messages`).

I also tested the last point by discarding the new message event if ""newest"" has not been found by the current message list.
Then if a new message is sent while fetching the last batch for that narrow then the message is missing. (as mentioned in the issue)

Looking at `exports.maybe_load_older_messages`, and comparing with `exports.maybe_load_newer_messages` in `message_fetch.js`, the problem is that this is just not implemented.  I think structurally we want this to be implemented as a hidden element inside the top of `bottom_whitespace` that can be shown/hidden as needed.

15055,message_edit: Always empty edit form before appending to it.,"Prior to commit 8b7e70ac2711372a0315b01179697ec644b33347 this system
would simply just .hide() forms when they were closed and
.empty().append() them when a new edit form was made. This was not a
very clean way of handling the action of canceling an edit, so
8b7e70ac2711372a0315b01179697ec644b33347 introduced a change that had
the ""show_edit"" function append the form and the hide function delete
the form. However, we overlooked the fact that the user could use
history to navigate away and back to the form and use ""e"" or ""left
arrow key"" to successfully append another form to element and get to
an ugly broken state.

This commit does not revert 8b7e70ac2711372a0315b01179697ec644b33347
as it is still accurate to .empty() when hiding the form, but we also
.empty().append() when showing the form, to avoid bugs like the above.
Fixes: #15045.

AS THE GIF SHOWS AT THE END: the current commit might not be an ideal fix, because if you're editing the form and click outside the form and use ""e"" or ""left arrow"" you're likely to delete whatever text you'd placed in the form... Should we change that?
Would it be an improvement if (instead of what this commit currently is) we modify the ""show edit message"" to check and early exit if there's already an edit form present?

seat_count should be 6 for some reason.  I'm not
sure why 6 is our magic number here, but this is
a less brittle way to decide which users are gonna

Without this change, you would get obscure
failures with logging in as Cordelia, if you
didn't know about the logic in `setUp`.  It's
easy to overlook `setUp` when debugging tests,
since it's not explicitly invoked.

To be clear, I suspect there's a good reason
to make the seat count predictable, since we
apparently ""salt"" it for some kind of mocked
responses--but I don't know the full story here.

fact was overlooked and a generic ""span"" selector was used with would
target all spans within the parent element, direct descendants or
otherwise, which caused the side effect of applying padding and margin
to inner katex elements which broke appearance.

This commit replaces the ""span"" selector with ""& > span"" so that only
spans which are the direct children to the parent element are selected
and katex--html is rendered correctly.

This is for a traceback from zulipchat.com. We missed renaming a function call when we first added the widgets.


Sidenote: I'm wondering if there was any way this could have been avoided in the first place. I must have missed converting all the calls to this function, that's human error and I should have been more careful, but the tests were passing because we had set `setting_org.old_function_name = noop` in the tests for dispatch.

Also of note is that this didn't come up in manual testing either. There may be other similar bugs lurking around like this.

Maybe we should come up with a way to confirm that when we set something to noop, that was originally a function in the original module.

We should fix this by adding a `process_fts_updates --audit` option that checks for and fixes this condition (it seems appropriate to put in that existing tool rather than somewhere else since it already has the settings setup, but a separate tool would also be a fine option).

The query we want to do is this:
`UPDATE zerver_message SET search_tsvector = to_tsvector('zulip.english_us_search', subject || rendered_content) where to_tsvector(subject || rendered_content) != search_tsvector`

Running this on chat.zulip.org finished in a couple minutes without any user-facing disruption, so I think we can probably recommend that command to everyone who isn't zulipchat.com.

* [ ] Write the audit option for `process-fts-updates`.  We probably should have it audit pgroonga records as well if that's enabled.
* [ ] Document it in the `do-release-upgrade` documentation as thing one needs to run.
* [ ] Backport that commit to the 2.1.x branch so we can ship it in a point release.
* [ ] Add the release notes for  2.1.x a recommendation to run the audit tool for anyone who's previously done a do-release-upgrade.

We should recognize things so that default is controlled by either a setting or half the number of CPUs on the system (if we can detect that efficiently), as a proxy for size.  Though that latter value might be bad in some memory-constrained containers on systems with a lot of CPUs, so might be a bad idea.

I think an acceptable solution would be:
* To create a `settings.DEFAULT_DATA_IMPORT_PARALLELISM`, set to 2 in `default_settings.py`, so that we use the parallel code path in development and production by default.
* Use that, rather than 6, as the default for `threads` and `processes` in all data import/export code paths.

I think this should be a relatively safe change, because all that bugs can do is cause some streams/realms not to get archiving run on them - or for the archiving to be called on too many streams/realms, but logic deciding which messages to delete is elsewhere and it reads the retention policy from those objects - so it won't accidentally nuke some stream or realm.",mateuszmandera,b'size: XL',2020-05-07T12:39:59Z,2020-05-07T23:28:42Z

14829,bugdown: Support hanging_lists preprocessor for indented lists.,"Previously, hanging_lists preprocessor didn't consider anything
indented at 4 or above spaces to be a list. This meant that when
we had a list like:

1. 1
  2. 2
    3. 3
  2. 2a
1. 1a

We would insert a newline between 3. 3 and 2. 2a. This resulted
in the block processor breaeking down 1 list into 2 blocks, which
messed up the nesting and indentation for the second block.

14828,Fix error handling for expired tokens in desktop app login flow,"Following https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/14747, if you complete the desktop app login flow to login the desktop app, and on the landing page (see https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/14827) and click ""Continue in browser""), we'll try reusing the login token, which is forbidden.

We could clean up the page, but @mateuszmandera is there a reason we don't just want to redirect back to /login in this expired case case?  (@andersk FYI).

A few other questions to think a bit about:
* How long do we want to give users to use the token?  
* Does it make sense to allow the token to be used more than once?  (Or the token to be used once and the link to be used once?)  Then a user who wants to login to both the desktop app and browser could do that in one login transaction.

In the new sentry_sdk client (at least the python one), `message` is only added for `capture_message`.

My guess is this is a permissions-type issue; `process_fts_updates` (the thing that updates our full-text search indexes) is probably not connecting to the right database or ""schema"" within the postgres database and thus not seeing the `fts_update_log` table that's there.

There's a few functions in `tab_bar.js`, e.g. `update_stream_name`, that may be called in some of the right places and are meant to do live-update here, but we didn't hook them up when merging #11894 because the original implementations had security bugs (inserting `rendered_description` HTML without using the appropriate template rendering).  

The right fix here is to just fully rerender the `tab_bar` component when we know the data going into it (stream name, description, privacy status, etc.) changes; this means we just need to tweak the existing rendering logic to support being called to rerender, and we can use that in all the relevant `stream_events.js` code paths.

14684,settings_org: Improve failure response of save_discard_widget.,"Previously, on receiving a failure response from the backend, the
changes sent with the request were not rolled back in the UI which
caused buggy behaviour. Styling of the failure case was not consistent
with styling of the other parts of the save_discard_widget. This commit
fixes this issue by updating the UI to previous changes, in case of
failure. And provides a much cleaner failure message, which can be
dismissed by clicking on it. This has been done by creating a new div

14678,logging_util: Handle record.status_code missing in skip_200_and_304.,"Fixes #14595.
Invalid HTTP requests could end up in an unhandled exception in
skip_200_and_304 due the record not having the status_code attribute
set. With this change we'll avoid the exception

Example:
`curl  -X POST -H 'Transfer-Encoding : chunked' --data-binary 'a' 'http://zulipdev.com:9991/json/messages/57'`

Because `update-prod-static` is failing, the actual error messages is in `/home/zulip/deployments/next/var/log/upgrade-prod-static.log`.

`update-prod-static` itself has very verbose output, so I think there's two paths forward:
* Simplest is to copy `build-release-tarball` in at least printing the path to `upgrade-prod-static.log`, and perhaps catching and not emitting much of that unhelpful traceback.
* Better would be to make `update-prod-static` have more sane output.",timabbott,b'area: production area: production installer bug priority: high',2020-04-19T04:31:34Z,2020-04-25T22:39:06Z

14596,stream settings: Fix UI feedback on clicking checkbox to subscribe.,"<!-- What's this PR for?  (Just a link to an issue is fine.) -->
https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/14481

Before this change, on clicking a checkbox to toggle subscription to a
stream no UI feedback was shown and users could toggle the checkbox
multiple times to send multiple requests causing bugs. This commit
initializes a spinner on clicking the checkbox, to provide a UI feedback
to the user. This commit also disables the checkbox once a request for
subscription has been sent and re-enables the checkbox only after a
response.

**Testing Plan:** <!-- How have you tested? -->
The testing for this has been done by adding a wait of 2 secs in
actions.py for the response. This gives sufficient time to test the
working manually. Also, for error cases an error has been sent from
action.py and the behaviour has been manually observed.

----------------------------------------
```

Normally, [http.server logs request, status code, size](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/http/server.py#L544-L545), and [Django extracts the status code from that](https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/core/servers/basehttp.py#L144-L157). However, [on errors http.server logs code and message](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/http/server.py#L457) and Django doesn't extract the status code.

Parsing arguments to log messages seems pretty fragile to me, so maybe it's better to accept that there isn't always a status code on a log record. Making `getattr` default to `None` in [`skip_200_and_304`](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/master/zerver/lib/logging_util.py#L122) is probably the best option.

I believe it's what happens where there's a race where a message is deleted after the user has read it but before the mobile push notification to remove it is sent.

There are probably 2 bugs here:
* When we delete a message, we probably don't send an appropriate ""remove push notification"" notice. (So if the user hadn't read the message yet, we might never tell the app)
* In `handle_remove_push_notification`, we do `bulk_access_messages_expect_usermessage`, which is wrong in the case the messages have been deleted.  I'm not sure we need that check at all -- there should be no possible security issues involving a remove push notification for a message you never originally received, and I think it was meant as a bit of an assertion that turns out to not always be true.

(We might want to do something with `ArchivedMessage` like we do in the push notifications send path for the similar deletion race there (which we have a test for!) to check that what happened is deletion, and not something else?  Not sure)

@mateuszmandera this might be an issue for you given the deletion angle here.

did a `DROP EXTENSION` on systems thta had upgraded, which meant that
backups created on systems originally installed with Zulip 2.0.x and
older, and later upgraded to Zulip 2.1.x, could not be restored on
Zulip servers created with a fresh install of Zulip 2.1.x.

We can't do this with a normal database migration, because DROP
EXTENSION has to be done as the postgres user, so we add some custom
migration code in the upgrade-zulip-stage-2 tool.

It's safe to run this whenever tsearch_extras.control is installed because:
* Zulip is AFAIK the only software that ever used tsearch_extras.
* The package was only installed via puppet on production servers configured to
  run a local Zulip database.
* We'll only run this code once per system, because it removes the
  package and thus the control files.

Fixes #13612.

14545,typeahead: Use stream participation for mention autocompletes in message edit.,"When adding a mention (at- or silent) in an edit, the autocomplete suggestions are not taking stream participation into account. Here's a reproducer:

1. When first writing a message, type `@_steve` and see what appears; it should be a stream-participation-aware list (which will likely have Steve Howell on it). You can include the mention in the message or not. Send the message.
2. Close the compose box. Having it open causes the edit view to work correctly.
3. Open the message edit view, and try typing @_steve again; it'll give you a non-stream-participation-aware list of Steves (who are all named ""Steve"", which according to Steve Howell is because it's falling back to being sorted by last name, which the ""Steve""'s don't have).

As mentioned, having the compose box open will cause the edit view to show a stream-participation-aware list; it needs to be closed to see this bug in action.

14514,user profile cards: Fix bug with deactivated user.,"We had a user have problems with the user
profile menus that you get when you click
on either sender avatars or mention pills.

If a deactivated user had a long enough email
that we would normally want to un-hide the clipboard
icon for them, we would crash inside of
`init_email_clipboard`, because the icon isn't
there for them.  If the user didn't have the
console open to see the crash, the symptom
became that you would get multiple cards
visible and kind of ""stuck"".

I chose to fix this by just making the code
defensive with respect to the absence of the
icon, instead of short-circuiting it for
deactivated users.

It's a bit odd that we still have an element
matching `.user_email_popover` in the profile
card for deactivated users, since that element
doesn't actually include an email, but it instead
says ""(This user has been deactivated)"".  I
considered removing the class, but the CSS
that we use for emails kind of applies here
too.

Testing this is a kind of a pain, as you want
either long emails or to just temporarily hack
this condition to true:

    if (this.clientWidth < this.scrollWidth) {
        // ...
    }

And then test with a deactivated user, of course.

Fixes #14473

14498,Fix live update for moving messages to a stream the user isn't able to see,"Following 7990676583b5094e1a12572a782ece7ed57b401e (Part of #6427 / #13912), we have nicely working real-time sync for moving a group of messages in a topic to a new stream.  (The UI hasn't quite merged yet, but I don't intend to block merging it on finishing this).

There's a bug where if a client receives an event notifying it to move messages to a stream ID it doesn't recognize, it'll throw an exception, because the client doesn't know anything about the new stream ID.

The right fix properly involves somewhat tricky changes in the `stream_changed` code paths inside `message_events.js` to basically just discard the messages if the target stream ID is unknown (rather than moving them to a stream_id the client knows nothing about and/or trying to renarrow).  Hopefully we can find a clean way to do this.

Fortunately, it's pretty easy to test this by just using the feature with a second browser logged in as Polonius and narrowed to the messages about to be moved; the one thing to be careful about when reproducing it is to make sure the public stream is one the guest user has never been subscribed to in the past (I'd just make a new stream).

Once we've fixed this issue, which sounds like it's only for guest users, we can look at relaxing the rules that currently limit moving messages to another stream to just:
(1) Organization administrators can do it.
(2) Where both streams are public.

Which are almost certainly too strict, but are necessary because of this implementation limitations (and changing them also requires some thought on policy).

14481,stream settings: Fix UI feedback for clicking checkbox widgets to toggle subscription,"In Zulip's stream management UI, it's possible to send several duplicate requests to subscribe yourself to a stream by clicking repeatedly.  This is confusing at best and buggy at worst.

This is reproducible as follows:
* Add `time.sleep(2)` at the start of `bulk_add_subscriptions` to create a delay.
* Open ""Manage streams""
* Open the browser inspector's network tab.
* Click the checkmark next to a stream you're not subscribed to repeatedly, and notice that each click triggers an additional network request.

We should change the mechanism to (1) show a loading indicator (perhaps in place of the checkmark?  I'm not sure what will look good visually) while the request is in flight and relatedly (2) prevent sending a duplicate request until the first one has received a response.

This bug is important because a bug in the transaction behavior of `bulk_add_subscriptions` can cause it to 500 on the additional duplicate requests, which happens routinely on zulipchat.com due to its scale.

14388,portico: Drop font-weight for links from landing-page.scss.,"This commit removes ""font-weight: 500;"" from landing-page.scss so as
to fix a bug on landing pages that used the `markdown` class to
format content. The bug was caused by ""a:hover"" from landing-page.scss
overriding the font-weight (600) on links as set by the markdown
class, this caused the text to seem jumpy when one hovered over links.
Fixes: #14387.

I am concerned that this might break styling for links on other pages, I haven't checked... so this might be considered WIP.

This was probably never a real world problem, since our current UI only makes it easy to set up one service per bot, even though the DB theoretically supports multiple services.  Also, we never heard of folks in the outside world trying to do this.

14351,Fix how the /team page generates contributor data,"We've been having periodic issues with the /team page on zulipchat.com losing the ""contributors"" data that lives at the bottom.  I think a proper fix for this will require some restructuring in how this is run.

Currently, the /team page is generated by `tools/update-authors-json`, which is a somewhat unreliable tool, as part of the `update-prod-static` pipeline.

This is bad for several reasons:
* We don't want failures in this tool to be able to break deploying a new release, so we potentially ignore failures in production environments.
* It is slow and makes deploying new production changes slower.
* It means there's no consistency in how often we update.

The right solution for this problem is to run it in a cron job, that can be much more patient (waiting minutes if need be) for GitHub to generate the results, and can complain more loudly if it encounters errors.

As part of this, we should make links to `/team/` on non-zulipchat.com servers just go to zulipchat.com (since we won't be including these data in release tarballs, etc.), like we do with /plans.

14244,Refactor lightbox code to fix buggy implementation of the image-list.,"Previously, `lightbox.open()` was responsible for retrieving the image data from the DOM, saving it in `asset_map` and finally displaying the image using that data. This implementation wasn't correct for image list at bottom of the lightbox because the `image` parameter passed to lightbox.open() could contain more than one instances of the image that had to be opened.

This commit refactors the lightbox implementation to fix it's behaviour for the bottom image-list. The changes are as follows:

- Seperated the image data parsing logic from the `lightbox.open()` and moved it into parse_image_data().

- Metadata of all the images is stored in the `asset_map` when an image is opened and the image-list is rendered at the bottom.

- Whenever an image-list element is clicked, the image is directly accessed from `asset_map` rather than relying on the original image element still being findable in the DOM.

The symptom of this was that these messages would get
""stuck"" in ""Private Messages"" narrows until the next
time you reloaded your app.

14201,tests: Use email/delivery_email more explicitly.,"We try to use the correct variation of `email`
or `delivery_email`, even though in some
databases they are the same.

(To find the differences, I temporarily hacked
populate_db to use different values for email
and delivery_email, and reduced email visibility
in the zulip realm to admins only.)

In places where we want the ""normal"" realm
behavior of showing emails (and having `email`
be the same as `delivery_email`), we use
the new `reset_emails_in_zulip_realm` helper.

A couple random things:

    - I fixed any error messages that were leaking
      the wrong email

    - a test that claimed to rely on the order
      of emails no longer does (we sort user_ids
      instead)

    - we now use user_ids in some place where we used
      to use emails

    - for IRC mirrors I just punted and used
      `reset_emails_in_zulip_realm` in most places

    - for MIT-related tests, I didn't fix email
      vs. delivery_email unless it was obvious

    - see any TODOs added here (in case I forget)

I also explicitly reset the realm to a ""normal""
realm for a couple tests that I frankly just didn't
have the energy to debug.  (Also, we do want some
coverage on the normal case, even though it is
""easier"" for tests to pass if you mix up `email`
and `delivery_email`.)

In particular, I just reset data for the analytics
and corporate tests.

        // this is the left and right of the image compared to its parent.                           
        const coords = {

```

Looking at the code here, our logic doesn't make much sense.  The setup that we have here is that:
* We've rendered this `image-list` object containing tiny thumbnails of other images in the narrow one can click on, with some data on the image in `data-src`.
* When you click on that image, we read that data from the `data-src` attribute.
* We then do something crazy, which is to now try to find in the DOM the unique (?) message row containing a something with that `data-src` value.
* So that we can call `lightbox.open()` on it.

That approach is crazy both because it's super weird and because we don't know for sure that there's only one place that there's a preview of the target image.  What we should be doing is:

(1) Splitting the data-parsing part of `lightbox.open` from the rest of it.
(2) When we render the `image-list`, computing the data that `lightbox.open` needs from the DOM and putting it into `asset_map`.
(3) Having the click handler for `image-list` look things up in the `asset_map` directly, rather than relying on the original image element still being findable in the DOM.

One possible reproducer approach for the exception we're seeing is the message containing the image the user clicked being edited to no longer have an image prefix in it in the DOM while the user has the lightbox open but before they clicked it.  The approach described above would prevent this failure mode (by briefly caching the details of the image for the duration of the lightbox session).

14151,Fix tracebacks hitting `escape` after repeated message editing,"@showell this may be a good issue for you to investigate and at least get to a proposed path forward, since the current state seems quite weird.  I found this via production exception reporting, and can reproduce this in a development environment.  The traceback is this:

```
 at Object.blueslip_error [as error] /static/js/blueslip.js:245
 at Object../static/js/rows.js.exports.id /static/js/rows.js:53
 at Object../static/js/message_edit.js.exports.end /static/js/message_edit.js:427

 at HTMLDocument.<anonymous> /static/js/hotkey.js:799
 at HTMLDocument.dispatch jquery/dist/jquery.js:5237
 at HTMLDocument.elemData.handle jquery/dist/jquery.js:5044
```

The reproducer is to find a private message sent long enough ago you can't edit it anymore, and do ""View source"" on it, and then hit `escape` while it's still selected.  The obviously buggy code is around line 214 in hotkey.js -- the `message_edit_content` widget for a PM you cannot edit will never be focused, I think, so we should be falling back to some way of selecting the row that includes unfocused elements.

The reason the fix isn't simple is that I notice several things here that seem wrong:
* It appears that `message_edit.end()` does not remove previous message-edit forms from the DOM, so if you open and close message editing on 5 messages,  `const message_edit_inputs` ends up having 5 entries, even though only 1 form might be open.  I think `message_edit.end` should be changed to remove the `message_edit` forms from the DOM (potentially included disabling the upload widget or something first), but I'm not totally sure.  
* There's kinda 2 duplicate implementations in hotkey.js; the first one for the selected message, and the later ones for whatever message has the focus if focus is on text.  I am not sure what the history is here but it seems weird to have both of these without at least a comment explaining why.

Combined with the fact that one can have multiple message_edit forms open, I'm not sure what the right fix is.  (I'd be fine with `escape` closing all open message_edit forms).",timabbott,b'area: message-editing bug help wanted',2020-03-09T03:38:39Z,2020-04-22T23:42:02Z

14097,message_header: Topic edit pencil sometimes missing from recipient bar controls.,"A recent bug was introduced that disables the topic edit capability of certain topics.  It's hard to pinpoint a pattern, but going farther back in a stream's history seems to be positively correlated to the number of topics that are affected.  

Currently as of writing this, eg, the `checkins` stream on [chat.zulip.org](chat.zulip.org) has topic edit options on the first few.  Scrolling up reveals sparsity among editable topics.  With the same topic, at one point, exhibiting both editable and non-editable states at different points of the interleaving (!). This is shown below in the screenshots.

Easily reproducible in the development environment; iago (realm admin) doesn't face this issue, but all other members do.

14096,Fix GitHub webhook support for requesting a team as a reviewer,"This is an issue with Zulip's GitHub webhook; we currently only support the `requested_reviewers`  part of a `review_requested` event, and not the `requested_teams` part.

Zulip installation failed (exit code 1)!

The install process is designed to be idempotent, so you can retry after resolving whatever issue caused the failure (there should be a traceback above). A log of this installation is available in /var/log/zulip/install.log
root@zulip-2001:/tmp/tmp.yliyQLjARE/zulip-server-2.1.2#
```

Something about how the virtualenv at `/srv/zulip-venv-cache/$hash` is being created is causing issues (note that I was able to recreate this with Zulip 2.0.7 as well).

## Steps to recreate

I provisioned an Ubuntu 18.04 container with LXD and performed the following:

1. `pip3 install virtualenv==20.0.1`, then followed the [installation guide](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/install.html#installer-details):

2. `cd $(mktemp -d); wget https://www.zulip.org/dist/releases/zulip-server-latest.tar.gz; tar -xf zulip-server-latest.tar.gz`

3. `zulip-server-*/scripts/setup/install --self-signed-cert --email=root@localhost.localdomain --hostname=zulip`

When version 20.0.1 is substituted with 15.1.0 or 16.7.10 on an identical container, the install process finishes without any errors. If virtualenv 20.0.1 isn't supported, I would think a check in the installer to ensure the correct version (or a note on the installation page) would be useful, since I imagine it would be common for people to want the latest version of virtualenv installed on systems.

I can provide more logs if needed. Thanks!",n-cc,b'area: production installer bug priority: high',2020-02-25T16:14:50Z,2020-03-23T11:06:20Z

There's a related bug and race issue when another user sends a message to a narrow while our browser is in the process of fetching the latest batch of messages in that topic.  The bug is that I believe currently we'll display the new message potentially temporarily out-of-order (appearing to be just after the messages we have already received from the server, when in fact there may be hundreds of messages still being fetched from the server in between).  That issue should be possible to fix using `fetch_status` to discard `server_events` events using the same techniques described in #13996.  But that would potentially leave a race would have the user's browser receives the `server_events` response containing the new message from the server, just before receiving the last batch of messages (with `found_newest=True`) that had been queried from the database moments before the new message was sent (with the end result being a missing message).

I think this is likely fixable through storing on the current message list any messages that we would have added to it but for `found_newest=False` (rather than discarding them) and then processing those as new messages once we reach `found_newest=True` if they were not already present in the message list.

> Without calling cov.erase() the data file seems to persist and even
pollute future test runs if not removed. Registering an atexit handler

Fixes #13933.

I think this is cleaner than a more hacky cleanup inserted at the beginning of ``test-backend``? And should be reliable enough, as according to atexit doc:
```
Note: The functions registered via this module are not called when the program is killed by a signal not handled by Python, when a Python fatal internal error is detected, or when os._exit() is called.
```

Which should be sufficiently unlikely to happen between the moment these files come into existence (at the first ``cov.save()`` call) and exit.

I'm wondering about whether we should add these ``.coverage.*`` files to ``.gitignore``, since they normally only exist for short periods of time, and I wouldn't have spotted this bug so easily if I hadn't had these files listed at the top in my VSCode source control bar - so it seems actually useful to have them annoyingly listed :sweat_smile:

13902,markdown: Escape all HTML entities in user content.,"Users need to be able to use HTML entities in chat and have them be interpreted literally, rather than being rendered as individual characters.

This is an attempt at solving https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/12056 - I'm still fairly unfamiliar with the intricacies of the markdown engine, so it's entirely possible that I've gone about this the wrong way, but the tests are passing locally and the behavior seems satisfactory to me.

To accomplish this, I added a preprocessor which subs `&(entity);` to `&amp;(entity);`. This solved almost all cases, but the indented `CodeBlockProcessor` was performing its own escaping which doubled up on the amps, so I subclassed it to remove that. The stock `backtick` processor performed that same escaping, but Bugdown has an existing subclass that doesn't perform any additional escaping. I did test script/HTML injection in indented code blocks and was unable to get HTML tags to render, so I don't think this has exposed any new holes, but it is worth doing more testing.

**Testing Plan:**

Added tests to test_bugdown.py

13805,Replace Dict and IntDict with native Map,"Hopefully we will soon convince ourselves that the run time type checking code in `Dict` and `IntDict` has served its purpose. Then we can entirely replace both of these classes with native `Map`, with benefits to interoperability, consistency, simplicity, and performance. I’m not too worried about new key type bugs creeping in, because `Map` doesn’t allow type-confused code to appear to behave correctly via implicitly stringification. We still have `FoldDict`, but I’ve normalized its API to be consistent with `Map`.

**Testing Plan:** Careful reading, `test-js-with-node --coverage` (every commit), `lint -g frontend` (every commit), `run-dev`.

13787,events: Investigate likely buggy stream creation event generation code,"We have this block of code in `zerver/lib/events.py` for processing stream creation events:

```
            for stream in event['streams']:
                if not stream['invite_only']:
                    stream_data = copy.deepcopy(stream)

I'm suspicious that this code is wrong.  Why should settings details like `is_announcement_only` be correctly guessable here, and why shouldn't we just be getting those values from the `stream_data` object?

 this looks like a consequence of upgrading postgres without installing the tsearch-extras package for that version of postgres. A success zulip-puppet-apply after the upgrade will install that package automatically.

However, I almost rejected the project out of hand because leaving the web page open pins one of my CPU cores at 100%. Looking into it I found that the **welcome tour click-here animation** caused the CPU spike (power user: I read man pages, I don't click bouncy animations).

Steps to reproduce:

1. Log in as a new user.
2. Idle at the web page (with one of the round animations showing)
3. Check top (brave wcpu 35%)

I see the issue on my laptop (Haswell laptop, Ubuntu 19.10, Brave **and** Firefox), but _not_ on my desktop (Haswell desktop, Windows 8.1, Nvidia graphics, Chrome and Firefox).
Moving to another tab makes the CPU usage drop to normal.
Finishing the tour makes the CPU drop to normal.

Is this worth looking further into? I will test on some other systems and see how they respond, and report back here.

13718,tests: Replace httpretty with responses.,"This is a blocker for tests for what I'm working on for https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/13613 But I believe this change stands on its own merits. What I directly ran into is that if httpretty is active, if the codepaths try to use redis, it will fail and throw an exception. Quoting the commit message:

> responses is an analogical module to httpretty for mocking external
URLs. Most important (in the moment) problem with httpretty is that it
breaks ability to use redis in parts of code where httpretty is enabled.
From more research, the module in general has tendency to have various
troublesome bugs with breaking URLs that it shouldn't be affecting.
responses seems to be less buggy and is much more actively maintained.

This thread from another big project that did this migration makes the argument better than I can - https://github.com/ckan/ckan/issues/4755 and most of their reasons apply just as much to us.

One tricky thing was that our ``block_internet()`` in ``test-backend`` would be conflicting with ``responses``, but instead, ``responses`` can be used to replace our custom logic and block internet access in tests on its own.

The history is this:

    Tim cloned the code (before the smaller
    helpers were extracted):

        db4f6e278f5600e89a2da8d626b38943d3977c59

    In 8b153f6452b178929d90fb6820e68a2f29c6e6da
    Shubham removed get_operator_subset_suggestions but
    accidentally left a `concat` statement in that got
    misapplied to the previous suggestions:

    -    suggestions = get_operator_subset_suggestions(operators);
         result = result.concat(suggestions);

    The error there was carried over in some recent changes,
    but this commit fixes that strangeness.

    In 73e4f3b3fad4b20abc7a3d458950564094a81a2b
    Shubham made this change, which makes sense only for
    pills, and this code remains intact.

        -    if (operators.length > 0) {
        -        last = operators.slice(-1)[0];
        +    if (query_operators.length > 0) {
        +        last = query_operators.slice(-1)[0];
        +    } else {
        +        // If query_operators = [] then last will remain
        +        // {operator: '', operand: '', negated: false}; from above.
        +        // `last` has not yet been added to operators/query_operators.
        +        // The code below adds last to operators/query_operators
        +        operators.push(last);
        +        query_operators.push(last);
             }

    Mohit made a couple changes to both old and new.

    Anders made a couple non-substantive changes related to
    the ES6 migration.

    Steve (me) made several structural changes to the code.  For
    some of them I only changed the legacy code, not the pills
    code.  I didn't fix Shubham's mistake until this change.

Now the two functions should look similar except in the places
where they are intentionally different.  I also added a comment
explaining the get_operator_subset_suggestions difference.

Fixes #13609

13605,"Fix ""private messages"" widget frequently rerendering and losing scroll position","We got this report from a user:

> ""We have been using this app for a very long time now. I have a major problem with it and wondering if there is a fix. When I am trying to search old private messages-- it is constantly taking me back to the top-- I am not able to search past messages with other people. It is extremely frustrating! Is there a way to open just my private message or can I change the time before it takes me back to the top of the private messages? What can be done to correct this issue?""

I think what's going on is ""Private messages"" is rerendering periodically (specifically, I think every time we get new presence data from the server), and that's resetting the scrollbar.  I'm aware of the rerendering behavior because it is super annoying when using ""Inspect elements"".  

I'm not sure what the best fix is; we could potentially avoid doing a rerender at all for presence updates where nobody's visual state changed.  Also, it'd probably makes sense to preserve the scroll position whenever we do such a rerender.  And maybe we should switch that component to use `vue` or something where updates don't require a full HTML replacement?  

But in any case, this seems worth fixing, so tagging it as a priority.

with led to bugs like not parsing a list that was immediately after
a quoted fence; we treated each ``` as a new fence.

This commit rewrites the function to maintain a stack of currently
open fences. If any of the parent fences is a code fence, we do not
insert a new line before a list.

We also add some test cases specifically to test this behavior with
complexly nested lists.

13583,Fix historical New User Bot messages to be sent by Notification Bot,"In 656f882a44b2a29414aafe22d724a09c493f1468, we eliminated NEW_USER_BOT, which was basically a duplicate of NOTIFICATION_BOT with a different identity.  What we should have done at the time was added a database migration to move all messages sent by the NEW_USER_BOT cross-realm bot to have been sent by `NOTIFICATION_BOT` instead, and then delete `NEW_USER_BOT`.  

This will fix a bug that causes `NEW_USER_BOT` to go through the `report_late_add` code path on zulipchat.com and probably any other Zulip server older than 656f882a44b2a29414aafe22d724a09c493f1468.

Tagging this as a priority because it is part of an effort to clear all known production-side JavaScript exceptions.

@mateuszmandera FYI this could be a good issue given your extensive recent experience with testing migrations.

Once we do this, we can consider changing the `report_late_add` code path to be a stronger error (I think we still want to check for it as a way to catch bugs).",timabbott,b'area: production bug priority: high',2019-12-28T19:50:13Z,2020-04-26T18:08:58Z

*Sourced from [handlebars's changelog](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md).*

> ## v4.3.0 - September 24th, 2019
> Fixes:
> 
> - Security: Disallow calling ""helperMissing"" and ""blockHelperMissing"" directly - 2078c72
> - Disallow calling ""helperMissing"" and ""blockHelperMissing"" directly - 2078c72
> 
> Features:
> 
> - Add new runtime option `allowCallsToHelperMissing` to allow calling `blockHelperMissing` and `helperMissing`.
> 
> Breaking changes:
> 
> Compatibility notes:
> - Compiler revision increased - 06b7224
>   - This means that template compiled with versions prior to 4.3.0 will not work with runtimes >= 4.3.0
>     The increase was done because the ""helperMissing"" and ""blockHelperMissing"" are now moved from the helpers
>     to the internal ""container.hooks"" object, so old templates will not be able to call them anymore. We suggest
>     that you always recompile your templates with the latest compiler in your build pipelines.
> 
> - Disallow calling ""helperMissing"" and ""blockHelperMissing"" directly - 2078c72
>   - Calling ""helperMissing"" and ""blockHelperMissing"" directly from a template (like in `{{blockHelperMissing}}` was 
>     never intended and was part of the exploits that have been revealed early in 2019 
>     (see https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1495). *It is also part of a new exploit that 
>     is not captured by the earlier fix.* In order to harden Handlebars against such exploits, calling thos helpers 
>     is now not possible anymore. *Overriding* those helpers is still possible.
>   - If you really need this behavior, you can set the runtime option `allowCallsToHelperMissing` to `true` and the
>     calls will again be possible
> 
> Both bullet points imly that Handlebars is not 100% percent compatible to 4.2.0, despite the minor version bump.
> 
> We consider it more important to resolve a major security issue than to maintain 100% compatibility.

13576,Ldap logging,"From the commit message:
Our ldap integration is quite sensitive to misconfigurations, so more
logging is better than less to help debug those issues.
Despite the following docstring on ZulipLDAPException:

""Since this inherits from _LDAPUser.AuthenticationFailed, these will
be caught and logged at debug level inside django-auth-ldap's
authenticate()""

We weren't actually logging anything, because debug level messages were
ignored due to our general logging settings. It is however desirable to
log these errors, as they can prove useful in debugging configuration
problems. The django_auth_ldap logger can get fairly spammy on debug
level, so we delegate ldap logging to a separate file
/var/log/zulip/ldap.log to avoid spamming server.log too much.

13554,user settings: cannot search users (too slow?),"This may be a duplicate of https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/13192, but in the rust-lang Zulip org I literally cannot search through the list of users. This is a problem since it prevents me from ""administering"" successfully! What happens when I go to the list of users is as follows:

* Searching simply has no effect at all
* Scrolling is very, very slow, but I can (it seems) in principle scroll through all the users, but I've never had the patience to test that theory
* Further, the size of the scroll bar seems to initially indicate a small number of users, and I cannot drag the scroll bar and pull it down to quickly jump to later letters of the alphabet -- pulling the bar all the way down the list only brings me later in the ""A"" names
* Once I scroll down, more names do seem to load, and the size of the bar shrinks

But to get to a name that starts with, say, ""P"", seems like it would take me quite some time if I scrolled manually.

- [x] With email visibility set to admins only, when I go to stream settings on an admin account, the email addresses for the ``Subcriptions`` section are in their hidden version userX@domain.

- [x] In ``Users`` tab in Org settings I'm having the Email column empty quite often. In those cases,
trying to use the search errors out:

This must be the code:
```
        if ($(""#deactivation_user_modal .email"").html() !== email) {
            blueslip.error(""User deactivation canceled due to non-matching fields."");

        }
```
Note that ``""Deactivation encountered an error. Please reload and try again.""`` does't seem to be showing up?

Trying to refresh the page multiple times, the column stays empty. But flipping the email visibility settings to ``Admins only`` and refreshing somehow makes the column show up:

13530,Running ./scripts/setup/install for the second time results in failure,"For generating Digital Ocean one click app base image, we run `./scripts/setup/install` on a droplet with `--no-init-db --self-signed-cert` + random hostname, email values and take a snapshot. After the user creates a droplet from the image and logs into the droplet, `./scripts/setup/install` script is ran again with `--certbot`, proper hostname, email to complete the installation. This used to work properly untill this release. The installer now fails with this error when the installer is run for the second time to complete the installation.

```bash
# Traceback from existing current one click app in digital ocean

Flushing memcached...
```

The previous one click apps also used to have the error `ERROR:  role ""zulip"" already exists`, but the script never failed. Instead the script use to continue the execution and complete the installation sucesfully.

After spending some time debugging I narrowed down cause of this new behavior to the commit 5290519a622ed00dbca1becd4b97f0b809637429. This commit made using ON_ERROR_STOP=1 mandatory while running psql. This commit was not present in 2.0.7. Thats the reason why psql continued the execution even after encountering the error in older one click apps.

Removing ON_ERROR_STOP=1 from the line su ""$POSTGRES_USER"" -c 'psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -e' < ""$(dirname ""$0"")/create-db.sql"" in postgres-init-db does results in sucessful completion of the installation.

Ofcourse, removing CREATE USER zulip; from create-db.sql also also results in sucesfull installation when the script is run for the second time.

I am not sure what is the right fix here though? Should we check whether zulip user is present in begining of create-db.sql and drop the user if present? Or do something complex and create the user only if the user is not present? @timabbott @andersk You folks might have better idea.

We fix this by using urllib to extract the paths. We also add a
check on the hostname; either its empty (relative url) or the

Since we're operating only on the path, we remove the check for
leading '/' in attachment_url_to_path_id.

This PR takes over from #13196.
**Testing Plan:** <!-- How have you tested? -->
Manual + Automated Tests

**Review Help:**

1. First commit _(has:link)_ by Dustin is mostly unchanged; there are just some refactoring in the tests to make them easier to reuse later.
2. Second commit _(migration)_ by Tim is unchanged.
3. Third commit sets up the way for has:image.
4. Fourth commit _(has:image)_ removes content_has_image as well.
5. Fifth commit _(has:attachment)_ leaves update_calculated_fields as a no-op since it still has a TODO left.
6. Sixth commit removes one of the last occurrences of content_has_attachment.

**Work Remaining:**

1. Remove the last few occurrences of content_has_attachment from the message editing codepaths. This part is slightly tricky as we have to maintain the has_attachment flag from before editing the message and compare it to the final result from bugdown. Naive attempts make the code ugly so I've kept it off the PR for now.
2. Comparing the urls to regexes can still have false positives but a database access to actually check if that url is indeed a valid attachment from Bugdown might not be worth it here. Maybe there's some approach I can't think of.
3. Address the TODO in update_calculated_fields or completely remove the function.",aero31aero,b'size: XL',2019-12-10T22:06:59Z,2019-12-11T19:16:32Z

That last one appears to be a HackerOne user trying to send an invalid API key.  I think the error handling behavior that we want is probably:
(1) We modify `cache_with_key` to check if keys are longer than the maximum supported by memcached or have invalid characters in them.  If they do, we by default log a warning (maybe using the `traceback` module so we know where it is and can do tactical fixes like what's suggested on the next item as appropriate) and return `None` (since with an invalid key, there's nothing in the cache).
(2) Additionally for `access_user_by_api_key`, I think it makes sense to make the function itself check that the input in a hex format string of the right length for an API key, and if not, do an appropriate `raise JsonableError`, since that should give a nice user-facing error for an invalid format API key.  

We wrap all Zulip access to memcached via our functions in `zerver/lib/cache.py`, so this shouldn't be too complicated to implement.  

@mateuszmandera this is probably a good quick issue for you; I'd like it to be done by someone who can write careful tests for the error cases.  I don't think it's a priority for 2.1 release planning.",timabbott,b'area: production bug',2019-12-10T20:12:02Z,2020-01-04T00:56:45Z

I think it's possible that this could be fixed by just adding a bit of code  in `fetch_user_profile_cross_realm` to canonicalize the `EMAIL_GATEWAY_BOT` email address to Zulip's default value (so that all exports use the standard email address).

13490,models: Add is_realm_admin and is_guest setters.,"Fixes #13452.
We add an option to control UserProfile.role through is_realm_admin,
is_guest properties. The issue with using these is that when changing
user's .role we want to create appropriate RealmAuditLog entries and
send events. This isn't possible when using these setters - the log
entries and events should be created if the role change in the
UserProfile is actually save()-ed to the database - and on the level of
the setter function, it's not known whether the change will indeed be
saved.
It would have to be somehow figured out on the level of post_save
signal handlers, but it doesn't seem like a good design to have such
complexity there, for the sake of setters that generally shouldn't be
used anyway - because we prefer the do_change_is_* functions.
The purpose of this change is mainly for handling use-cases like the
linked issue #13452, where some library function we don't control needs
to do setattr on these boolean properties.
For this reason, this change includes linter rules warning against
using the setters directly.",mateuszmandera,b'area: authentication bug priority: high size: M',2019-12-08T19:42:56Z,2019-12-09T20:21:32Z

The main issue should be easy to reproduce in the development environment by adding a `time.sleep(5)` inside `by_search` in `zerver/views/messages.py` (making every search take 5+s` on the backend).  

The obvious approach would be something like this:
* We move the logic to hide the notice at the start of `narrow.activate` and only show it after `message_fetch.load_messages_for_narrow` completes (via putting the code to show it in the `cont` continuation) (if the client needs to go the server) or in the `select_immediately` code path (where the browser has enough cached message history to show the messages immediately).  

But it's possible we actually want to move the logic for this to e.g. `message_list_view.js` or `message_fetch.js` or `fetch_status.js`.  @showell do you have an opinion on where this should go?

@thedeveloperr @vinitS101 FYI.

13430,Optimize fetching of mention data for wildcard mentions,"In #13128, we are introducing this TODO:

```
+            # TODO: We should improve the `mention_data` logic to
+            # populate the possible_wildcard_mention field based on
+            # whether wildcard mention syntax actually appears in the
+            # message, to avoid wasting resources computing
+            # wildcard_mention_user_ids for messages that could
+            # not possibly contain a wildcard mention.
```

Fixing this will avoid a performance regression in rendering of stream messages to large streams, and so is well worth doing; the regression isn't so bad to block merging #13128 in the first place, however.

This requires some restructuring of the code in `zerver/lib/mention.py` and its calling code path in bugdown to extract and save the information for whether there's a potential wildcard mention in the message.

We will also want to apply this optimization to the `message_edit` code path.

13389,A few longer administrative strings tagged for translation are not actually translated,"I got a report from one of our translators that two of our settings pages, `/#organization/filter-settings` and the bottom of `/#settings/your-account` have large sections that don't seem to be translated properly:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2746074/68517108-077a4100-023b-11ea-8b7a-79cf5349a3bd.png)

What's weird is that the blocks are tagged for translation with `tr this` and have translation data in the `locale/` directory, which would suggest that the bug is in the handlebars+i18next integration or how we're using it (we're extracting the strings correctly for translator, but not actually doing the substitution correctly at runtime).  Debugging is required.

If I had to guess, I suspect the problem is that these are the places where we're using `tr this` with a multi-line block of text, and we're stripping whitespace in only one of ""when we construct the strings for translation"" and ""when we try to substitute translated strings"".  If you look in the `translations.files, e.g., there's no leading whitespace on those lines:
```
locale/zh_Hans/translations.json:  ""An API key can be used to programmatically access a Zulip account. Anyone with access to your API key has the ability to read your messages, send messages on your behalf, and otherwise impersonate you on Zulip, so you should guard your API key as carefully as you guard your password. <br /> We recommend creating bots and using the bots' accounts and API keys to access the Zulip API, unless the task requires access to your account."": ""API Key用于编程开发访问你的Zulip账户，任何人使用你的Key都可以：读取你的信息，使用你的身份发送信息，所以请不要公开API Key，像保护你的银行卡密码一样保护好它<br />我们建议创建机器人账户权限的API Key来访问Zulip API，除非某些特定任务需要
```

which would suggest maybe it's that the runtime whitespace handling is **not** stripping whitespace whereas the string-extracting time code is?

We can now share sections of our code between different entry points—no more duplication between the `app` entry and the `common` entry, for example. Each page now uses a single webpack entry, split into multiple chunks—no more duplication between multiple entries included on one page. Best of all, webpack computes the split automatically, so we can go forward with modularization work without having to worry about this nonsense. The release tarball magically shrinks by 1.3 MB compressed, 4.9 MB uncompressed.

There is one caveat, hence the draft marker: code splitting necessarily entails giving up some control over the inclusion order of CSS files, which it turns out we were incorrectly relying on. Some of these bugs are known and not yet fixed here, mostly due to `media.scss`, whose rules must be included after the rules they override.

13309,BUG: Zulip crashes when creating Linkifier,"Hello,

we are currently using Zulip 2.0.6 on an ubuntu 18.04 LTS server. We experienced some weird behavior yesterday when creating a linkifier. After the linkifier was created, you couldn't access the UI. It only showed an internal error.  It didn't just show it to the person that created the Linkifier but also to the rest of the users on that server. Turns out the problem was the name of the regex group! 'name' is apparently not a good name for the group.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a linkifier:
    Pattern: `#WIKI-(?P<name>[a-zA-Z]+)`
    URL:      `https://whatever/%(name)s`
2. Load the web interface or try to use the Desktop app and you will get an internal error
3. Remove the linkifier via the API; Zulip works again
4. Create a linkifier where `name` is replaced with `wiki` and Zulip still works

The log hinted at a group, which was why I figured out it was the regex group that created the problem. The log read as follows:

13298,Avoid showing a registration form at all when unnecessary with SAML+LDAP,"For organizations that are using just SAML authentication (or SAML + LDAPUserPopulator), and don't have Terms of Service configured, it's very possible that we'll end up offering a registration form with literally nothing to do after clicking ""Continue to registration"".

We should avoid this and just take the user to the app.  I think the way to fix this is to figure out why the `form.is_valid()` call in `zerver/views/registration.py` is failing in this code path; I would have expected it to pass.  I think the most likely bug is that the `field.required` change here should be one level less indented, but it needs testing:
```
        if not (password_auth_enabled(realm) and password_required):                                 
            form['password'].field.required = False

13294,Improve error handling in push notification bouncer service,"Apparently, our code for sending push notifications to the remote Zulip server doesn't properly handle network errors (i.e. before one gets to an HTTP error) when trying to connect to the bouncer server; those just result in an unhandled exception which gets emailed to the server administrator.  This is not ideal in cases where e.g. there's transient network downtime between the Zulip server and the push notifications service.

Based on the `do_api_query` code of `python-zulip-api`, which has been pretty well tested, we'll want to do something like this:

https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/11715
https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/9277
possibly some other related ones :thinking: 

1. We swtich to our fork of django-auth-ldap, where I implemented searching in LDAP by email.
2. . A rather unpleasant migration of tests to slapdtest. This is where most of the large number of line changes of PR comes from. This is necessary, because as explained the main migration commit:
> the fakeldap setup we used, with mocking of django_auth_ldap.config.ldap.initialize, would permanently affect the internal state of the ldap modules for all other tests

so having any fakeldap-based tests broke slapdtest (the ldap modules would keep trying to connect to fakeldap instead of slapd.). Plus switching to slapdtest has various other benefits, so I think we're definitely better off relying on that everywhere.

3. We fix email_belongs_to_ldap, to search for emails in the directory rather than blindly returning True.

4. Use email search in django_to_ldap_username, which allows fixing the flows of things like getting api keys and sync_user_from_ldap, which use user_profile.email as the identifier, by allowing them to translate that email into the proper ldap username.

13225,messages: Render topic links in context of stream realm.,"Priviously, we rendered the topic links using the msg.sender.realm.
This resulted in issues with Zulip's internal bots not having access
to the realm_filters of the destination stream's realm. For example,
sending a message via the email gateway would not linkify any realm
filters that a user would expect them to.

The solution here is to call bugdown.topic_links with the stream's
realm's id, however, when we create a message's json dict, we only
have access to the message object. Thus, we add a new field to the
AbstractMessage: rendering_realm.

**Testing Plan:** <!-- How have you tested? -->
Manual testing by running the following and derivatives on `./manage.py shell` and checking the results on the webapp:

stream = Stream.objects.filter(name__contains=""design"")[0]

iago = UserProfile.objects.get(email__contains=""iago"")

I'm not sure what the right fix is.  The data is passed from the backend to the frontend in a dictionary (`page_params.emojiset_choices`, grep for `EMOJISET_CHOICES`) ; probably the best option is to add a sort key field to the dictionary generated in `zerver/lib/events.py` (which ends up in `page_params`) and use that for sorting in the handlebars templates.

which is configured to only support a single process.  The `do_update_user_activity` function is pretty simple -- does a single check with the database and then a single write.  But the throughput means that one round trip per update is likely too much.

Most requests to Zulip are presence requests or `/events` requests; from a production log file:

```
root@prod0:~# zgrep presence /var/log/zulip/server.log.7.gz  | wc -l
3725186
root@prod0:~# zgrep events /var/log/zulip/server.log.7.gz  | wc -l
4483721
root@prod0:~# zgrep -v presence /var/log/zulip/server.log.7.gz  | grep -v events | wc -l
1550199 # everything else
```

So cutting which endpoints are handled here won't make much difference, since `presence` is already not included and we need the `events` data.

The UserActivity data isn't used for a lot -- mostly manual analytics inspection.  But there are some production codebase use cases that require the data to be up to date within 5 minutes (the main one being a check in the zephyr mirroring code) and others that use it (inside /activity).

The actual update code is pretty simple:
```
def do_update_user_activity(user_profile: UserProfile,

    activity.last_visit = log_time                                                                                                        
    activity.save(update_fields=[""last_visit"", ""count""])                                                                                                                                                                         
```

There's a few ways we can fix this without just adding additional parallel workers (which would be fairly doable the same way we do it for the `message_sender` workers if need be).  I think the best is as follows:

We use a strategy similar to what we use for the `MissedMessageWorker`: the queue processor drains events from the queue and then batch-processes them, either every few minutes or just whenever it has no events to drain (deduplicating events in Python by just combining the counts and using the later of the timestamps).  I think the data structure used by the queue worker for this tracking can be just a dict mapping tuples `(user_profile_id, client_id, query_str)` to a tuple `(count_incr, last_visit)`.

Combining this with changing that 5 minute threshhold for Zephyr mirroring to e.g. 15 minutes to give a bit of breathing room, this would likely be pretty effective.  And it would nicely let us automatically recover from duplicate events.

On the discussion of this issue, it was said that if the recipient of the message is a bot, it shouldn't have an availability circle at all. But for me personally, it was kinda odd seeing no icon at all besides the name of the bot, and also I think it would be less confusing if it had some indication that that user is a bot. So, I put a bot icon, but I'm not sure if it is nice or ok. What do you think @timabbott and @rishig ?

13111,settings: Add FAKE_EMAIL_DOMAIN setting.,"Continued from https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/13107 (since I can't reopen it).

Fixes #9401.

This adds a FAKE_EMAIL_DOMAIN setting, which should be used if
EXTERNAL_HOST is not a valid domain, and something else is needed to
form bot and dummy user emails (if email visibility is turned off).
It defaults to EXTERNAL_HOST.

get_fake_email_domain() should be used to get this value. It validates
that it's correctly set - that it can be used to form valid emails.

If it's not set correctly, an exception is raised. This is the right
approach, because it's undesirable to have the server seemingly
peacefully operating with that setting misconfigured, as that could
mask some hidden sneaky bugs due to UserProfiles with invalid emails,
which would blow up the moment some code that does validate the emails
is called.

This renames the pub_date column of Message to date_sent, and handles migrations in 2 parts, analogically to https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/13062

Did some testing around in the development environment, and it seems to be working fine.
One detail is that the names of the indexes on date_sent won't be exactly how they'd be if we just did simple RenameField migrations that Django would generate. But this is intentional, because Django doesn't rename indexes when renaming a column, so it leads to a weird state of having
an index named ``zerver_archivedmessage_pub_date_509062c8`` on ``date_sent`` column and it seems better to change this manually to have ``zerver_archivedmessage_date_sent_509062c8``.

13082,URL pattern for login page is too broad,"This is an oddity I noticed in the course of debugging #13081 / zulip/zulip-mobile#3594.

The login page normally appears at the URL path `/accounts/login/`. There are several other patterns which begin with that path and correspond to specific ways of logging in -- for example `/accounts/login/local/` for local dev auth, or `/accounts/login/social/github` for GitHub auth.

But if you visit some other URL whose path starts with that one, and isn't one of the expected patterns, then that URL turns out to be accepted too. For example: https://chat.zulip.org/accounts/login/asdf/nonsense

That URL gives a generic Zulip login page, exactly the same as https://chat.zulip.org/accounts/login/ . (It's not even that it redirects to one -- rather, the ""nonsense"" URL remains in the browser's location bar.)

The reason is that this pattern in zproject/urls.py :
```
    url(r'^accounts/login/', zerver.views.auth.login_page,
        {'template_name': 'zerver/login.html'}, name='zerver.views.auth.login_page'),
```
matches all sorts of nonsense URLs, like that https://chat.zulip.org/accounts/login/asdf/nonsense
 . (The more-specific URLs that I know of are all handled by preceding patterns.)

There's a fair amount of code behind that route, and I'm not sure if there are any URL paths it matches, other than the exact `/accounts/login/`, which it's actually intended to match. But it surely isn't intentional to match `/accounts/login/a-b/2/3`. The fact that it started matching `/accounts/login/google/` after the specific pattern for that one was dropped certainly contributed to the debugging time needed for #13081. And if there are any paths beyond the base one which are indeed intentional, it'd surely be helpful to make those explicit.

13073,Fix desktop notifications for wildcard mentions in muted streams/topics,"The correct behavior, as described in #6040, is that we should not do desktop notifications for wildcard mentions (e.g. `@all`) in muted streams or topics.  I just merged 5e19546c148bd46544cc5b120df6fdc5655c4f7a which covers one of the more complicated pieces of it.

This replaces #6040 which is pretty cluttered at this point; the `unread_msgs` data work has been completed, as has been the work to make email and mobile push notifications for wildcard mentions do the right thing of not notifying in muted streams.   I've extracted the following outstanding items from #6040: 

> When new messages reach the frontend (including when the 1000 recent history messages are loaded), `exports.process_loaded_messages` in `unread.js` currently looks at whether messages were mentioned (in any capacity) and adds them to the `unread_mentions_counter` data.  We'll need to change this block:
 ```
        if (message.mentioned) {                                                                     
            exports.unread_mentions_counter.add(message.id);                                         
        }                                                                                            
```
Note that I think `message.mentioned` already takes wildcard mentions into account, so we may need to do some refactoring to have the data we need available here.

> The narrow including these messages.  For this, the best thing to do structurally is pretty challenging.  We need to change this section of `by_is`:
```
        elif operand == 'mentioned':                                                                                  
            cond1 = column(""flags"").op(""&"")(UserMessage.flags.mentioned.mask) != 0                                    
            cond2 = column(""flags"").op(""&"")(UserMessage.flags.wildcard_mentioned.mask) != 0                           
            cond = or_(cond1, cond2)                                                                                  
            return query.where(maybe_negate(cond))                                                                    
```

to add an additional filter clause that removes messages that (1) don't have the mentioned flag and (2) have a recipient that's a muted stream.

And then we probably also need to modify `can_apply_locally` in a corresponding way.

Looks like a regression was caused in 02cfb47315322c88b7b3730ba7a784fd67094121 as a result of removing the following tags (related #13049):
```html

  aria-label=""{{t 'Filter exports' }}""/>
<div class=""progressive-table-wrapper"" data-simplebar data-list-render=""admin_exports_list"">
```
Also updated to use `Object.values(exports)` to return an array of each exports enumerable values.  As well as adding `.init()` which looks standard for implementations of this kind, but were missing here.

lag of 800ms as in ""saved"" state. Furthermore, when all settings are restored to
the original state (i.e. there is no net change in the state of input elements),
""discard"" state is more intuitive.

defaults to 0 so there will no impact of this change.

12959,[WIP] Denormalize the display_recipient cache from the message bodies,"PR for issue https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/12818

Commit 1 implements a rough fix for the described bug, but does a lot of calls to fetch display_recipients (which can be either cache fetches or db queries).
Then we try to make it more efficient and handle things in bulk - which is done in the 4th commit.

I would consider this close to ready, but  two main issues:
1. Typing on arguments in generic_bulk_cached_fetch in commit 3. I elaborated on this in https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/49-development-help/topic/generic_bulk_cached_fetch.20argument.20types 
I'm not sure what the right of handling the typing is, so I just changed things to Any, consistent with the typiing of what `` query_function `` is supposed to return. Perhaps this could be `` Union[Model, Dict[str, Any]`` instead - as the object from the database will usually be either a Model or a dictionary coming from a Django query with `` .values('field1', 'field2')``

2. In the ugly function for bulk-fetching display_recipients in the last commit, huddles need to be handled in bulk too - but I wanted feedback on whether my approach is reasonable before I dive into implementing this mildly tricky scenario.",mateuszmandera,b'has conflicts size: XL',2019-08-08T17:20:53Z,2019-08-20T19:26:21Z

12877,events: Workaround badly behaving browser caching.,"The code comments explain this issue in some detail.

In theory, the cache control headers that Zulip specifies via
patch_cache_control should prevent this situation from happening, but
we've had a number of reports of users seeing an invalid state clearly
caused by the browser using a stale version of the webapp's HTML and
thus page_params, resulting in it feeling like the Zulip window
travelled back in time a few hours (I've had it happen to me myself).

We can fix this by adding error checking that is reasonable to do in
any case (and could, in theory, catch other bugs): Rejecting requests
to fetch events from an events queue that have already been pruned /
garbage collected.

Fixes #12876.

12876,Prevent browser caching from resulting in invalid unread states,"Browsers increasingly do experimental, potentially buggy things with caching (especially in situations like trying to reload a tab after returning from suspend without going over the network).  Zulip attempts to prevent this on the webapp's main endpoint (/) via `patch_cache_control(response, no_cache=True, no_store=True, must_revalidate=True)`, which should disable all browser caching.  We've verified that the HTTP headers indeed make it through to the browser, so that's not the problem.

However, empirically, Chrome at least sometimes will on a flaky network (re)load one to a state on e.g. chat.zulip.org where messages you read in the last few hours are shown as unread.  Reloading the webapp fixes the problem, so it's clear the server-side state is correct.  Because of how Zulip's unread messages system works:
* Initial data on unread messages is sent to the client via `page_params`, which is encoded in the HTML for the main Zulip webapp page (`/`).
* Zulip has no mechanism for read messages becoming unread

, it's clear that the browser is using the HTML from a previous load of the webapp in restoring the page (and thus using a stale version of all the data in `page_params`, most visibly, the unread counts).  

Since we don't have a reliable reproducer for this, it's unlikely we can get the browser vendors to fix it.  What we can do is make Zulip's webapp robust to this sort of incorrect browser caching behavior.  

After an extended discussion with @andersk, one way we could fix it without making too many assumptions about browser behavior is this:
* Because of the expected structure of the cached reloaded webapp, we should expect the client to have a stale state of everything in `page_params`.  In particular, it will be initialized with a very old value of the `last_event_id` parameter -- probably `0`, even though the actual event queue will likely have been in use for much longer.  
* This means we can patch `fetch_events` in `zerver/tornado/event_queue.py` to look at requests that have a `last_event_id` older than the newest garbage-collected event, and return a special error for them.  
* This should have no impact on properly functioning clients, since they have a monotonically increasing `last_event_id`.
* This should have no impact on properly functioning clients experiencing network retries and races, since if the client resends a `get_events` request, it is expected to cancel and/or ignore the response if a previous `get_events` request is returned by the server, so it should never process the new error.
* We can extend the browser client to check for this new error, and if it sees it, destroy its event queue, show a user-facing error, and try to reload itself properly.

12868,Improve virtualenv-clone hashing logic,"Our `virtualenv` management logic is designed to have a few properties:
* After running `provision` or the equivalent production operation, you always have a correct virtualenv as though you'd built it fresh
* We avoid the performance pain of redownloading and/or rebuilding all of our packages fresh for the common operations of ""adding a new package"" or ""upgrading a minor version of a package"", both in the development environment and in production.
* https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/dependencies.html is a useful reference.

There are a few issues we need to fix with the current implementation:
* We don't currently compare the `Python` version when deciding whether we need to build a new virtualenv from scratch.  
* Our index of packages included in the virtualenv doesn't have package versions; we should include those and only allow package upgrades to use the `virtualenv-clone` plus cache approach (downgrades are often not tested upstream).

We should be able to test whether the implementation is working manually through inspection of `/srv/zulip-venv-cache/` before and after adding a new python dependency (see the docs for how to do this using `update-locked-requirements`), downgrading in `dev.txt`, and upgrading/downgrading the Python version itself.  We don't currently have unit tests of any this logic, though it wouldn't be a bad idea to write some simple tests of the logic functions from `scripts/lib/setup_venv.py` in `tools/tests/` somewhere (`tools/test-tools` is the runner for those).

12819,"Static pipeline cleanup, round 2","This has an assortment of changes to make our static file handling more consistent with what Django expects. `STATIC_ROOT` is now unset in development. We write generated static files directly into `static` (regardless of `STATIC_ROOT`) where they will be picked up by `collectstatic`. We find and serve static files using the Django functions designed for that purpose.

Then, we get rid of django-pipeline, which we’re no longer really using for anything.

This also makes using production assets with the development server a little less broken. I won’t go so far as to say this counts as “working”, but if you’re adventurous you can 1. set `DEBUG = False`; 2. `tools/update-prod-static`; 3. `tools/provision` (to undo the damage `update-prod-static` did to `node_modules`); 4. `tools/run-dev.py` (which also starts `webpack-dev-server` but ignores it).

While we are thinking about this, we may want to consider also adding support for an option in `get_messages_backend` to only include IDs in the `display_recipient` structure (or maybe just not include ` display_recipient`, and instead send just the IDs in some other structure?

You can't see my mouse pointer in this screenshot, but it's over on the right, on the ""Mute stream"" item:

I think we should also make it so deleting all the messages of a group-pm live removes that group-pm from the list instead of having to reload. I haven't looked into it that much though, I'll have to track down how to do that.

12621,Typeahead Cursor Position Bug,"This issue has been discussed in https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/9-issues/topic/user.20typeahead.20regression.3F.

When you press enter on a typeahead and start typing, your cursor is placed at the end of the textbox, whereas we want it to be placed at the end of the typeahead immediately. This causes some characters to appear at the end of the message before you again get to typing where you left off.

This is a timing bug, possibly caused by bootstrap-typeahead triggering `.change()` on `#compose` which moves the cursor to the end and our code which then moves the cursor back. It should only be noticeable on typeaheads with a large number of items.

Potential fixes:

1. Patch bootstrap-typeahead to not trigger `.change()` after setting the value of the textbox.
2. Use the `$('#compose').change()` event in our typeahead code instead of the currently used `setTimeout` to place the cursor.

12588,Allow linkifier tokens to be set (and used) per stream,"Linkification is great.  Being able to put an issue number in chat and get the full link to that issue is very convenient.  We used to do it with Redmine and IRC.  We never set that up again after moving to GitLab for project management, but now that we're moving to Zulip and i saw how [easy it is to define linkifiers](https://agaric.zulipchat.com/help/add-a-custom-linkification-filter ), I went to set it up again— and realized there's a problem.

For GitLab, GitHub, and undoubtedly other project management tools and bug trackers, issue numbers are **repository-specific**.  This means there's no way to drop an issue number or (easily) a commit hash and get a working link— unless Linkifiers can be context-aware, and we can add tokens to streams to define that context.

For example, an administrator could define two tokens available to streams— `organization` and `repo` (and perhaps the administrator could set defaults, say, `zulip` and `zulip`.  Then in stream Terminal for discussing the Zulip Terminal, a user could set the `repo` token to `zulip-terminal` in the stream settings.  Then the issue number example (hash followed by a number of any length) could look like this:

-  Pattern: `#(?P<id>[0-9]+)`
-  URL format string: `https://github.com/$organization/$repo/issues/%(id)s`
-  Original text: `#352`
-  Automatically links to: `https://github.com/zulip/zulip-terminal/issues/352`

For organizations that use one stream per project like we do, allowing the definition of token fields that can be set in streams, and letting linkifiers use these tokens, addresses the use case that inspired #11222 also.  Rather than trying multiple repositories for commit hashes, the linkification pattern could make use of tokens that get different values for each stream.

So this is two separate, but simple, enhancements: organization-wide definition of tokens that can be set per stream (probably called ""tokens"" rather than ""linkifier tokens"", as i'm sure per-stream tokens could be useful in other contexts, such as bots) and Linkfier URL format strings being able to interpret these tokens.",mlncn,b'area: markdown area: settings (admin/org) new feature',2019-06-16T01:55:45Z,2020-07-21T22:32:55Z

12551,Retention: batching + logging + delete objects in one query with their archiving,"Addressing comments made in https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/12499#issuecomment-499616595 :

> I think I mentioned batching queries to BATCH_SIZE messages at a time (probably we'll want ~1000).

Implemented in the first commit

> We'll want to think about logging that we might use to debug issues with this system. We should setup a logger object for retention.py (see examples in other files; I think we also have a doc on it).

Simple version of this in the third commit. I'm not sure if we want to specify some extra settings for this system's logger in settings.py?

> Related to logging, I was thinking we might want to group the archive_stream_messages function by realm, and log the realm string_id and total number of messages archived when we're starting processing a given realm in both the PM and stream code paths. 

Implemented in commits 2-3.

> There's number of queries performance optimization we could do with archive_messages_by_recipient to have it support taking a list of up to RECIPIENT_BATCH_SIZE~20 recipient_ids with the same policy; not sure it's worth doing that refactor now, but I wanted to mention it since we now have the structural setup where doing that refactor would make sense. (I'm imagining we'd construct in Python a dict mapping retention_days_value -> [recipient_ids], and then use that).

Wouldn't this refactoring be in direct conflict with above approach of grouping things per-realm for logging purposes?

> For delete_expired_attachments, if we were to do the per-realm approach suggested above, given realm column for the Attachment with an index, would that mean we could do those as per-realm queries? I think that'd make life a lot easier for tracking down potential performance issues to do smaller per-realm queries.

I don't feel confident touching this, because I'm not sure how exactly linking to attachmens works? I assume the .realm field is set when someone uploads and posts an attachment for the first time, according to the realm where this action happens. Afterwards, other messages can use this attachment - I'm not sure if a message in another realm can do that? If it can, then that complicates things  I think.



The last commit implements deleting some objects in the same query as they're archived - we do that because these objects are guaranteed to be deleted anyway due to their CASCADE property.

12523,Fix LastPass inserting the user's password into the DOM in our API key form,"LastPass will aggressively insert the user's password into any HTML field with the ""password"" format.  This potentially means that our `#settings/your-account` features which have the user enter a password might have the password automatically entered by LastPass even when those parts of our forms are hidden (but still in the HTML).  What I'd like to do is move the form containing `#get_api_key_button` into a modal (like our ""Change password"" UI) that is rendered dynamically only when the user clicks the button to fetch their API key.

It should be a relatively simple migration and would mean LastPass only fills the password into the form when a user has actually clicked into UI where their password might be relevant.

This is also a useful preliminary step for https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/6341 in addition to fixing the described issue.  ",timabbott,b'area: settings (user) bug in progress priority: high',2019-06-07T00:15:09Z,2019-08-14T17:55:42Z
12522,Loading indicator for fetching more messages does not have a night theme variant,"Zulip's night theme (""display settings"") apparently doesn't override the styling for the loading spinner for more messages (Which spins around the ""Z"" at the top of the message feed), making it basically invisible.  It's easy to reproduce on chat.zulip.org; in a development environment, I'd recommend using `./manage.py populate_db -n5000` to make it easy to trigger repeatedly (by rebuilding the test database with a bunch more messages so the `home` key always fetches more from the server).

12521,Improve validation of our OpenAPI declared arguments against reality,"Something that's incredibly valuable in maintaining API documentation is making sure that we keep it up to date as the API changes.  Our API documentation isn't complete yet (see https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/10044), but in 1de4b94fbe04e57c5959001ec8e881f36718cb15 I added an automated test that does a comparison between our API documentation and the actual arguments declared in our view functions.  There's a bunch of TODOs remaining to make this system really nice and have it add more coverage of possible bugs (I've marked the ones with an explicit TODO comment in the test, below):

* [x] Not all arguments are intended to be documented (e.g. there's backwards compatibility, etc.).  We should add an option to `REQ` with a name like `intentionally_undocumented=True` that causes it to not add the argument to the `arguments_map` data structure. (and thus not to considered for whether we've documented all arguments that should be documented in our test).  This should let us remove a bunch of things from `BUGGY_DOCUMENTATION_ENDPOINTS` that aren't actually buggy, they just have arguments we don't want to document (e.g. because they're old legacy things).
* [ ] Remove other things from `BUGGY_DOCUMENTATION_ENDPOINTS` that are there just because we added an argument and didn't update the documentation when we did so.  E.g. https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/11136.
* [x] TODO: Figure out a way to handle this matching between the OpenAPI format for parameters and the `urls.py` format: `/messages/{message_id} <-> r'^messages/(?P<message_id>[0-9]+)$'`.  We might want to handle this by having a loop over all OpenAPI endpoints in addition to our existing loop over all `urls.py` endpoints, because doing so would allow us to also verify that every endpoint in the OpenAPI codebase is being successfully matched to the corresponding actual code.
* [x] TODO: Add support for using this syntax supported by `rest_dispatch`: `{'POST': ('zerver.views.report.report_error', {'intentionally_undocumented'})}),` to mark in the `urls.py` which endpoints we expect to never have public API documentation (e.g. because they're used only internally by the webapp codebase).
* [x] TODO: This is lower priority than the main issue, but it'd be really cool to cross-validate the types declared in OpenAPI against the types declared in `REQ` (via the `validator` parameter).  We may not be able to do this always, but 95% of the time it's `check_int` or `check_str` or `check_dict`, and we can certainly map those to the expected type.

This unfortunately is hard (or even impossible) to reproduce but is there anybody who is experiencing the same problem? We are at least two. 
AFAIK it happens when
1) receiving a new message at the time the given conversation is showing
2) switching to zulip with alt+tab
3) sending a message

Can't tell if the scroll is always the same distance but mostly it's going back to between 1/3 and 1/2 of the current conversation on that day.

12486,Fix leaking test templates in test_runner.py,"<!-- What's this PR for?  (Just a link to an issue is fine.) -->

N = self.parallel templates are created, and these templates were
previously named 'zulip_test_template_<1, N>'.  However, to support
running multiple instances of `test-backend`, a unique
`random_id_range_start` was created for each template database.

There was no problem prior because the templates would simply be
used again and thus did not require any clean up. Now that there are
unique database names being created, every time `test-backend` is run
these templates can accumulate on disk.  Instead, we clean up our
templates at the end of every complete run of the test suite, or upon a
SIGINT.

12446,Quote-and-reply doesn't handle code blocks properly,"If you use quote-and-reply on a message containing a code block without a language specified, like this one, it doesn't work, because we treat the start-block marker as an end-block marker for the quote:

https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/49-development-help/topic/Vagrant.20Docker/near/747567

I think there's a few reasonable ways we could handle this:
* Have quote-and-reply generate a ""``` endquote"" marker, and look for those?  Seems messy because manually created quote blocks (e.g. for pasting an email, or whatever) might not have these (though I suppose we could have typeahead add it).  Maybe the best version of this would be something like ""``` quote 12345"" (message ID, which we were talking about for another feature anyway for showing more rich information) with a ""```endquote 12345"" later in the message (and we'd know we need to find an endquote with that ID because of the ID on the quote?)
* Try to add a special `nonquote` language marker (which has no effect other than not being a possible end for a quote block) when doing quote-and-reply on a message that has a code block in it.  The annoying part of this is that we'd need to parse the message pretty thoroughly to do that.

Actually, I think we leak them unconditionally right now; possibly because the code in `teardown_test_environment` is confused.... I tried the below patch, but it did not seem to fix the problem (I don't know why).

12381,Fix LDAP avatar synchronization not checking if the avatar has changed,"The comments starting here https://github.com/zulip/zulip-desktop/issues/695#issuecomment-493252147 have more details, but basically, when we run `manage.py sync_ldap_user_data` with a thumbnailPhoto field configured, we end up re-uploading (and re-notifying about) every user's avatar regardless of whether or not they've actually changed, which is really expensive in a bunch of ways.  

Ideally, we'd be able to prevent that by just comparing the image content, but if that proves difficult (because of e.g. thumbnailing), we could store a hash of the original avatar image somewhere (maybe `RealmAuditLog` for lack of a better idea?) and use that to check whether there's a new value.

When we want to fetch an API key from the setting modal, we have to input our password, but if the submitted password is wrong, the warning is shown at the top of the setting modal instead of being shown next to the password field. This is pretty confusing since most of the users won't notice the warning because they have to scroll to the top of the modal first.

How to reproduce:
1. Log in to Zulip.
2. Open settings.
3. In ""Your account"" tab, scroll down and find the API key section.
4. Click on ""Show/change your API key""
5. Fill a wrong password in the current password field.
6. Click on ""Get API key"" button

Then the warning will be shown at the top of the setting modal.

Expected result:

The warning should be shown next to the password field.",refeed,b'area: settings (user) bug',2019-05-22T17:44:56Z,2019-08-15T23:59:12Z

12304,Follow-ups to notification settings database model migration,"I just merged an important migration in #11507, to change the model for our global stream notification settings to be a default (for all streams where one hasn't explicitly set a value) rather than just a default for any new streams created in the future.  This model is much more intuitive and will enable us to do a bunch of things (listed near the bottom of this issue).

There's several important follow-ups; I'm putting several of these in a single issue for simplicity of issue creation:
* [x] Clean up a bunch of the code duplication around this batch of settings. I think probably the first priority here will be to rename the non-matching database field of enable_stream_sounds vs. audible_notifications, since that makes the mapping between field names algorithmic, and then we can deduplicate the bundle of functions including `stream_audible_notifications_clicked`, receives_desktop_notifications`, `update_calculated_fields`, and remove a conditional in `handle_stream_notifications_compatibility`, etc.
* [x] @rishig Update our user docs and the text on the page to be consistent with the new data model to the extent it isn't already.
* [x] @gnprice The mobile team needs to verify that post migration, their ""stream settings"" UI works with the app in master (i.e. that we correctly did the backwards-compatibility work), since while it is very likely to work, that hasn't been explicitly verified as part of testing this.  
* [x] Fix this subtle 2-browser real-time sync bug, which requires 2 browser windows: if you toggle an account-level global setting, it doesn't live-update a currently active ""stream edit"" widget -- but it's fixed for any new ""stream edit"" widgets you click on. I think this is probably something we can fix in a high priority follow-up issue if we want to get this into master -- I doubt users will find it.
* [ ] Proceed with https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/12182 and https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/9228, as well as making a ""pinned streams"" global notification setting bundle, which are the rest of the notifications redesign we're hoping to complete soon.

* We use `test_realm_boolean` in `frontend_tests/node_tests/dispatch.js` for some fields that are integers, not boolean; we should either change its model to match some of other property types tests on the backend that can support multiple data types (and rename it to `test_realm_property` or something), or add a similar function for integers.

12239,Linkifier URL validation regex is broken,"The linkifier validation regex doesn't allow things like ampersands (for query parameters) or forward slashes following the last placeholder.

Ampersand example: https://example.com/?foo=bar&id=%(id)s
Forward slash example: https://example.com/product/%(id)s/details

Either of those results in a validation error saying ""Invalid URL format string"".

[Here's the relevant function as of the latest commit](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/272ed9068590e575e09c5abaeffca48040164873/zerver/models.py#L635):

```python
def filter_format_validator(value: str) -> None:
    regex = re.compile(r'^([\.\/:a-zA-Z0-9#_?=-]+%\(([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)\)s)+[a-zA-Z0-9_-]*$')

    if not regex.match(value):
        raise ValidationError(_('Invalid URL format string.'))
```

Note that in the first character set, which is for what comes before a placeholder, there's no ampersand (or semi-colon), and in the third character set, which is for what comes after the last placeholder, there's less; not even a forward slash, which is what blocks the second example above.

The second character set is for the placeholder names. This is also broken in practice, because it allows hyphens. While placeholders are allowed to have hyphens in Python, named groups in regular expressions are not, since they have to be valid Python identifiers. This could come up if someone tries to use a name with a hyphen, only gets a validation error for the regex, and mistakenly changes it only there, not in both places.

Which segues into something that should probably be its own issue, since it goes beyond the regex itself, but I'll mention it here. It's possible to have non-paired named groups and placeholders. If there are named groups that don't have a matching placeholder, they're just silently dropped, which isn't breakage but may not be ideal. However, if there are placeholders that don't have a matching named group, the message isn't sent, although it still appears in the sending client instance, with the target string linkified with the unfilled placeholder still visible in the URL. In the web and desktop clients, there are red Retry and Cancel buttons on the right when hovering over the message; Retry has no obvious effect, and Cancel removes the message. In the mobile client (on Android, but I assume it's the same on iOS), there's a spinner that isn't moving to the right of the message. Long pressing bring up the menu with an option to Delete, but since I'm an admin on this instance I can do that anyway, so I don't know if that's equivalent to Cancel from the web/desktop clients.

12220,settings: Fix broken headers in night mode.,"This bug turned out to pop up wherever a table existed in both
'settings' and 'organization settings', notably *excluding* both
'Custom Emoji' and 'Authentication Methods'.

The first thought to the solution was to simply add `thead` to the css
rule that applies the appropiate color for headers and the like.  This
was successful, however it brought attention to a sub-problem:

`emoji-settings-admin` and `auth-mehtod-settings-admin` were both
creating table headers in the body of the table. This was causing the
rows in these two tables to be colored inversely from all the others.
This is also the reason why these tables are the only ones correctly
styled. These handlebars were updated with the headers moved out of the
body.

The even and odd rows of the tables were then colored appropriately.

Fixes: #12209

All tables are now styled similarly to the following:

We should disable the ""Mobile notifications"" line in stream settings and add the question mark help (similar to how we do it Settinsg -> Notifications) when the push bouncer is not set up.

12198,"notification settings bug: Visual toggling of ""Mobile"" in private messages UI","This issue is related to the messy `if_and` business in the settings_checkbox template.  Basically, the template has correct behavior, but whenever you toggle any setting, `settings_notifications.update_settings()` gets called, and that ends up always checking the checkbox for ""mobile"" in the private messages bundle, even though that checkbox was disabled.  

I believe the issue here is that `update_settings` should be taking into account the realm-level `page_params` value for whether push notifications are enabled in the organization.

Tagging as a priority since real-time sync issues like this can be really confusing for years.

12177,webpack: Fix node_modules path resolution.,"Webpack applies special logic to relative paths provided in `resolve.modules`, and this logic is expected to be used for `node_modules`.  One case where this is important is when `node_modules/foo` wants to import a different version of package `bar` than the one at `node_modules/bar`, and so yarn gives it its own copy at `node_modules/foo/node_modules/bar`.

It would probably be better to avoid screwing with `resolve.modules` at all, but this at least brings us one step closer to the default of just `[""node_modules""]`.

*/etc/zulip/settings.py*:
`EXTERNAL_HOST = 'discuss.internal.mysite.com'`

If I have settings like this:
```
# ADD_TOKENS_TO_NOREPLY_ADDRESS = True
TOKENIZED_NOREPLY_EMAIL_ADDRESS = ""noreply-{token}@mysite.com""
# Used for noreply emails only if ADD_TOKENS_TO_NOREPLY_ADDRESS=False
# NOREPLY_EMAIL_ADDRESS = """"
```

Invitations and test e-mails have correct `from` - tokenized noreply email address, as expected.
However private message reminders go from `noreply@discuss.internal.mysite.com`.

If I change setting to:
```
# ADD_TOKENS_TO_NOREPLY_ADDRESS = True
TOKENIZED_NOREPLY_EMAIL_ADDRESS = ""noreply-{token}@mysite.com""
# Used for noreply emails only if ADD_TOKENS_TO_NOREPLY_ADDRESS=False
NOREPLY_EMAIL_ADDRESS = ""noreply@mysite.com""
```
private messages have correct `from`: `noreply@mysite.com`

From the comment it looks like `NOREPLY_EMAIL_ADDRESS` is not used at all when `ADD_TOKENS_TO_NOREPLY_ADDRESS = True`, which is not true.

- inactive tabs (eg ""mentions"" and ""stars"") were hidden behind grey box.
- topic tab was hidden behind grey box in topic narrow.

- ""private messages"" tab in individual/group pm narrows was illegible.

These were all results of unexpected differences in precedence rules

11995,Jira to Zulip stream integration,"We just integrated the webhook into a stream.  The idea is that any critical ticket that is created and commented on shows up in a ""critical issues"" Stream in Zulip.  Though we didn't specify topics, each ticket that is created shows up in the ""critical issues"" stream with a topic of the ticket number.  For now, this is fine.  But when people comment on the critical ticket, it shows up in a "":"" topic.  So if there are multiple comments from multiple tickets, they all appear in the "":"" topic.

I went through all of this - https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/137-feedback/topic/Zulip.20Integration.20Docs.20on.20Mobile/near/708632 

The reason why I didn't use a logo because there was a particular a `div` that contained the logo along with the box and all and it was appearing on the web version of the page and by default, it was hidden for mobile pages(`display:none`). Making any changes to that div was altering the whole design. So, I instead copied the `img` tag and tried using the place, I wanted the logo to appear. But, it was not working. So, I opted to use this.

I think the current design is simple and does the work. Let me know.
This PR closes the https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/11701",sameerchoubey,b'area: documentation (api and integrations) bug priority: high size: S',2019-03-21T09:19:39Z,2019-05-21T06:41:33Z
11944,Allow requesting data on recent PM conversations via /register,"The mobile app's PMs screen shows the PM conversations we've been in recently, but ""recently"" may be as few as the last 100 PM messages. For a user that heavily uses PMs, this can leave out conversations even from a day or two ago.  One user reported an example as a typical experience: they're looking for a specific conversation, and the last message in it was 3pm yesterday. It's 3:30pm at the time they look, just over 24hr later. It doesn't show up on the PMs screen, though 6 other conversations do.

This is a data issue -- the mobile app doesn't have a convenient way to query these data.

With in part this issue in mind, the Zulip backend as of Zulip 1.9 added a nice database index for PMs that a given user has received; so we can very quickly do queries on that data.

The really dumb version that could be done with the API today would be to do a GET /messages is:private narrow query, but that would be a lot of data over the network. Probably what we should actually do is write a function similar to the ""more topics"" function that takes advantage of this index to get you e.g. the (PM recipient User ID list, last_message_id) tuples covering e.g. the last 1K PMs you've had, which probably is a <10ms query on the database end, and either include the data in /register or a separate endpoint (depending what's better for mobile's architecture); I expect it'd be <1hr work for me to add backend support for this if we had confirmation of what format the mobile app wanted. And the app should be able to maintain that data set after /register as new messages come in, since it's basically just ""look up the user_id_list, and bump the last_message_id"".

(Until the database index work in 1.9, this would have been prohibitively expensive, since we'd need to scan all messages to find enough PMs, which for low-PM users in an organization with a lot of streams traffic could have easily involved the database needing to look at 50K+ messages of history and thus adding 100sms of latency).

I don't think this data set would need unreads data, since the client should have that and be able to splice it in directly and it's probably cleaner to have one source of truth there, but it wouldn't be hard to include.

Discussion in https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/issues/3133 suggests we should use a dict data structure, not a tuple, e.g.
```
[{
    user_ids: [1, 2, 3],
    last_message_id: 23451,
    ...
}]
```

I think the query we'll want is roughly UserMessage.objects.filter(user_profile=user_profile, flags=UserMessage.flags.is_private).order_by(""-id"")[0:1000] will get the conversations we want, and then we just need to format the data.

We also need a name for the data structure; maybe `recent_conversations` is good enough.

The super optimized version of the key database query is this:
```
zulip=> select sub.recipient_id, max(sub.message_id) from (select um.message_id as message_id, m.recipient_id as recipient_id from zerver_usermessage um join zerver_message m on um.message_id = m.id where um.user_profile_id=8683 and um.flags & 2048 <> 0 order by message_id desc limit 1000) as sub group by sub.recipient_id;

11929,Add caching for bugdown rendering for realm descriptions,"We should add simple `cache_with_key` style catching for the markdown rendering of realm descriptions; that currently adds about 5ms even for a trivial realm description to the minimum call time of `common_context`, which sounds like not much, but can be more than half of the total runtime of some simple routes.  And this could potentially be a lot more if markdown rendering for a given realm description is expensive.  

While we're working on this, we should also probably do the following extraction:
* Move the variables only used for the login/accounts_home/registration pages, like `realm_description` and all the flags about auth backends to a separate `login_context` context processor, and only call that processor from the login/registration views.  

This should save a significant amount of time when loading other portico pages like /help/ articles that don't need those data.

This implements Tim's suggested approach at https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/9840#issuecomment-434876717

1. We make email_token a unique column.
2. We make stream_name in the receiving address completely ignored, the code only looks at the token to decide to which stream it should send the message.
3. We change how the stream name gets encoded - I decided to go for django's slugify function, since in my mind it seems to be perfect for this: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/utils/#django.utils.text.slugify
Things like Cyrillic characters just get dropped by slugify, which means the stream name can get ""slugified"" to an empty stream. We cover this case by skipping the stream_name part in that case. decode_email_address is prepared for this scenario too.",mateuszmandera,b'area: notifications (other) bug priority: high size: XL',2019-03-17T12:46:14Z,2019-03-18T18:16:48Z

11809,Improve performance of `set_pm_conversation_count` in `static/js/pm_list.js`,"I was doing some frontend profiling earlier today on chat.zulip.org, and ran into a case where `update_dom_with_unread_counts()` took 163ms, which is definitely high for that sort of update.  100ms of that was 20 calls to `set_pm_conversation_count` in `static/js/pm_list.js`, each of which was consuming 5ms.  This is a bit odd because I definitely didn't have 20 conversations with unread messages in the PM list.

I suspect this is partially some sort of UI scalability issue, where this only happens because there's a large number of users in the organization, but also in part a bug that `exports.get_li_for_user_ids_string` is such an expensive operation and we're calling it not just for the PM list entries whose unread counts might have changed.

11805,copy-paste with ctrl+C is broken on Firefox with Windows+Linux (sender names are missing),"Here's what happens when you copy-paste with ctrl+C on Windows:

```
So, just to explain what's going on there are 2 copy-paste implementations.
  12:27 PM

One is the ctrl+C / ctrl+V implementation, which is in static/js/copy_and_paste.js and has pretty extensive tests.
  12:28 PM

The second is what happens if, (at least on Linux), you select text and then just paste it with e.g. the middle mouse button, which does not trigger our copy-paste handler and instead is determined by the ordering of elements and the no-select tags.
  12:28 PM

For me, at least, in Chrome the ctrl+C one works great, and the other one is somewhat messy.
12:30 PM

On chrome everything seems to work fine, the problem exists on Firefox...
1:07 PM

one way to handle this would be to have a popover menu when you select more than 1 message of text, that allows you to select one of a few copy options (e.g. copy selection, copy selected messages, copy message content with full info like sender and timestamps)
  1:08 PM

(or V1 can just be the middle one: copy messages, which is the one I want 90% of the time)

11791,Linkifiers with overlapping patterns are linked twice in topics,"Given two linkifiers, `#(?P<id>[0-9]+)` and `some-other-repository#(?P<id>[0-9]+)`, that overlap then, in my testing, the more specific pattern is matched in messages (where possible), but in topics, both patterns are matched and two link buttons are shown where this may not be desirable.

As a more concrete example, in Rust's Zulip instance, we have a linkifier with the first pattern above, that links to issues and pull requests in the main `rust-lang/rust` repository, and we have multiple linkifiers matching the second pattern with other repositories. Within a topic where the name matches the second pattern, the linkifier should only link to that repository, and the `#xxx` at the end shouldn't also match the first pattern, as it wouldn't link to a meaningful or relevant `rust-lang/rust` issue.

One potential improvement that could resolve this would be to let linkifiers be sorted in the organization settings and then check the patterns in order, stopping after the first match. Optionally, patterns could also have an option that would say ""keep checking other patterns even after matching this pattern"" for users who wish to maintain the old behaviour.",davidtwco,b'area: markdown bug priority: high rust community request',2019-03-05T23:58:46Z,2019-03-11T18:50:06Z

Copying my troubleshooting from the [zulip topic](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/31-production-help/topic/user_uploads).

* Upgraded via git, to the 2.0.0 tag
* Impacts both new uploads and old uploads.
* New uploads don't trigger any errors, and show up where they're expected to on the zulip filesystem
* restart-server script does not resolve issue, neither does rebooting the server itself..
* Our conf.py is boring:
```
[machine]
puppet_classes = zulip::voyager, zulip::static_asset_compiler
deploy_type = voyager
```
* nginx.conf identical to [Zulip's nginx.conf in repo](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/master/puppet/zulip/files/nginx/nginx.conf)
* We're using a self signed cert, but trying to access images from machines which have a matching cert authority installed
* When I try to go to the URL of the image directly, it makes me authenticate- which I thought wasn't going to be supported on Trusty (instead images would be served without regard to authentication)
* I remember [this commit](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/efe85453039e9ef9e1a7a503e33d8b21e91e5fa9#diff-7f650084f892af5ba032222273d372e7) is were Zulip first started authenticating local uploads, but it has support for the older versions of nginx
* Content-Security-Policy was added in [this commit](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/d608a9d315a3dae90033d36cdf591eb3227ce30e#diff-9b57523c22e695172bd9a625be44ddfc) to uploads-route.direct, then further modified in [this commit](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/4898fe7ebc4e249e487a84b81cf2730cb24ced33#diff-9b57523c22e695172bd9a625be44ddfc) but removing that line doesn't result in being able to view uploads (even after full reboot)

'bugdown_wrappers'. A simple test has been added as well based on the
new test introduced in commit #de65a04.

The need for a new module is that in the future as Zulip adds markdown
rendering to more areas, we would want to ensure that we can easily
enforce any restrictions for that area in a simple wrapper around the
bugdown engine's convert method and then reuse that wrapper.

Though I'm not 100% sure if making the new file/module was the best
thing to do. I *do* think that it's a good measure which does some future
planning, but as I just said, I'm not sure. 

I'd greatly appreciate some feedback on this choice.",Hypro999,b'size: M',2019-03-01T11:39:28Z,2019-03-07T01:16:20Z

11708,Improve robustness of organization settings to refactoring,"In ab95704d2d9ec6f6f86a7023fbe060024e3415a6 we fixed a bug that nearly made it into the 2.0 release that made several options in ""Organization settings"" not work at all.  The bug was caused by a refactor that on its face looked totally reasonable.  So I think we need to change the organization settings system to be a more robust to HTML template refactoring, either in the form of making tests fail or making failures less possible.

One idea that I think could help is to move this configuration that lives in the JS of which widgets have which types:
```

to instead live in the HTML templates, via e.g. `data-setting-widget-type=""bool""`, and have `get_subsection_property_types` read it those types (as well as determining which settings are subsections of a given heading) as attributes out of the HTML.  That would generate the nice property that the HTML and JS can't disagree about which attributes belong in which subsection, and thus make this category of bug impossible.

11692,ldap: Remove invalid_subdomain restrictions on LDAP backend,"We got a report from a user that they were trying to use our LDAP backend with organizations on several subdomains, with the idea being that users could auto-create accounts in any of the subdomain organizations.

11656,Fix focus issues when someone sends a message while you're editing the latest message,"I've occasionally noticed a problem where I send a message, am editing it, and then someone sends a reply while I'm typing my edits, and the text area loses focus (resulting in my next characters triggering hotkeys, not entering text into the message I was editing)

The reproducer for this is very precise:
* Send a message as Iago in one tab from a topic narrow.
* Start editing the message, leaving focus in that window
* In an incognito window, login as Cordelia 
* Tab back to Iago's window -- Note message edit still has focus.
* Now from Cordelia's window, send a reply to the message Iago sent.
* Tab back to Iago's window -- the message being edited will have lost focus.  Characters you type will be treated as hotkeys.

This is a priority issue because it comes up in a common flow and produces pretty unexpected results.  It may be a bit tricky to trace, though, because the bug may involve some subtle details involving `message_list_view` doing a rerender of the message being edited -- I think that's the most likely explanation for this issue happening only when you're editing what was previously the last message in your narrow.

In particular, the `merge_message_groups` logic for Cordelia's incoming message results in a `message_actions` object that will rerender Iago's message and then also add Cordelia's message.

So the bug here is either that the rerendering of Iago's message is unnecessary (possible; I'm not 100% sure why we need to do that) or that we should avoid losing focus in that process (sounds difficult given that the HTML is being replaced).",timabbott,b'area: message-editing bug difficult priority: high',2019-02-23T01:20:22Z,2019-07-23T14:15:38Z

  1. Changes the UI of the ""Create stream"" form to make the
     textarea previously used to get the stream description

     line description).

  2. Adds an extra check on the frontend side to make sure that
     when users create a new stream via. the ""Create stream""
     option in the settings panel, they can't enter any newline
     characters (i.e. we disallow the enter key from being
     registered when typing out the stream description).
     We must also make sure that they cannot copy-and-paste over
     descriptions containing newline characters.

NOTE: Because of the 1st change (UI change) for the most part, users are already prohibited from entering newline characters making the 2nd change partially redundant. However, since these extra checks are not particularly expensive, they would be a good idea to keep.

11586,alert_words: Performance improvements in looking for alert_words.,"This commit leverages the ahocorasick algorithm to build a set of user_ids
that have their alert_words present in the message. It runs in linear time of
the order of length of the input message as opposed to number of alert_words.
This is after building a ahocorasick Automaton which runs in O(number of alert_words in entire realm)
which is usually cached.

<!-- What's this PR for?  (Just a link to an issue is fine.) -->


**Motivation and Implementation**
Currently the logic for finding alert-words in the message content include iterating over the entire alert-words in the realm multiple times i.e.) once to building `possible_words` and another time to check if the each of the `possible_words` is present in the message content. 

The runtime complexity of this is `O(number of words per user * number of users in a realm)` which keeps going up with increase in the users in the realm. 

Using [Aho-Corasick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho%E2%80%93Corasick_algorithm) algorithm we will be able to do this with a runtime complexity of `O(length of the message content)` after building the Automaton which takes time similar to building `possible_words` . The length of the message content is more or less fixed and smaller in size as opposed to the number of users which can grow as we scale. 

With is commit we can shift the runtime complexity of finding alert-words in message for the entire realm from depending on the number-of alert-words in the realm to length of the message.

I'm using a open-source python package [pyahocorasick](https://pypi.org/project/pyahocorasick/) with BSD License ( BSD-3-Clause and Public-Domain)

**Benchmarks**

I ran benchmarks by generating different number of alert-words with varying lengths of message content .I have created this large number of alert-words for a few users however this is equivalent to a larger number of users with lesser alert-words since the processing of alert-words happens after we take into account all the alert-words in the realm. 

I plotted the difference between the time taken using the regex implementation and the ahocorasick from my branch [here](https://imgur.com/a/WGTOOOb)

- For < 10 words the existing implementation does slightly better than the ahocorasick implementation (by 0.01s), due to the overhead of building the ahocorasick Automaton.
- The time taken to build the ahocorasick Automaton only takes around 0.7s on average for around 50k alert-words in realm. This slight bump in pre-processing helps us achieve linear time complexity later on. 
 - For all alert-words >10 for all varying lengths of content the ahocorasick implemntation does better than the existing implementation especially as the number of alert-words increases the time taken by the ahocorasick imlpementation remains pretty much the same. 
- We'll be able to extend this implementation to do more rules like matching opening/closing parenthesis, looking for substring etc easily without much changes.   
- Even if the time gains is minimal I feel it makes a significant impact as we add more processors to the markdown.

causing some operations to be applied on a destroyed emoji popover.
This commit fixes it by making sure to apply any operations on the

11559,"push notif: Don't forget to clear ""active"" flag on sending to bouncer.","Since da8f4bc0e back in August, this control flow has caused
`flags.active_mobile_push_notification` to be cleared if we don't send
these `remove` messages at all, and if we send them directly to GCM...
but not if we send them via the Zulip notification bouncer.

As a result, on a server configured to send `remove` notification-messages
via the bouncer, we accumulate ""active"" messages and never clear them.

If the user then does `mark_all_as_read`, we end up sending a `remove`
for each of those messages again, and all in one giant burst.  We've
seen puzzling bursts of hundreds of removals pass through the bouncer
since turning on removals on chat.zulip.org; it's likely many of them
are caused by this bug.

This issue was made more acute with f4478aad5, which unconditionally
enabled removals.

In test_bugdown_fixtures function, I have passed test['input'] instead of test['expected_output'] in assert_equal function which gives failed testcase. Now with using subTest , the information of test is displayed on terminal window , which was not displayed earlier.

11488,"""Sent to wrong narrow"" notifications do not appear for messages that can't be locally echoed","Read https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/markdown.html and https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/sending-messages.html before working on this issue so you know what's going on.

Our ""you sent a message to a different narrow"" banner (and other notifications about sending to unusual places) is triggered by `notifications.notify_local_mixes`.  We only call this here, in the case where the message was locally echoed:

```
    if (locally_echoed) {                                                                                                              
        var need_user_to_scroll = render_info && render_info.need_user_to_scroll;                                                      
        notifications.notify_local_mixes(messages, need_user_to_scroll);                                                               
    }                                                                                                                                  
```

Messages are not locally echoed when `markdown.contains_backend_only_syntax()` returns true; the simplest example is the URL of an image (which would be rendered to include an inline preview of the image by the backend).

We should be calling `notifications.notify_local_mixes` for messages you sent from the current client but that could not be locally echoed.  This is complicated by the fact that we don't have a natural way to detect which messages which were not locally echoed were sent by the current client, as is.  So the fix for this issue involves:
(1) Changing our message-sending logic to still compute some sort of `local_id` and send it through the API to the server, even if we did not locally echo the message, and adding whatever state tracking we need to trying to replace a locally echoed message if we didn't actually locally echo it.
(2) Changing that variable `locally_echoed` to `sent_by_this_client`.

This is a somewhat complex issue that will require some careful code-reading, but likely only a handful of lines of changes that aren't renaming variables for clarity.

11451,Make to_non_negative_int support a maximum argument,"Our `to_non_negative_int` REQ converter (read our ""developer tutorials"" if you don't know what this is) should validate the maximum for the integer, and return a user error in the case that it's too large.  

Probably should change it to a nested decorator `to_non_negative_int(max: int=None)`.  See `api_key_only_webhook_view` for an example similar decorator.  The error message can be e.g. ""'%s' is too large (max %s)"".

I think it makes sense to have a default maximum of 2^32-1 (for the use cases that are e.g. a message ID), but probably some call points will want something more like 10000.  

As a reproducer, here's the exception if you e.g. put a bunch of 9s as your message edit time limit.

11410,hipchat import problem - empty streams ,"hello, 

there is an import problem in zulip when doing import from hipchat.

after import, i observed that for a lot of channels/streams were empty.

apparently that happens, if in hipchat (we were using free version) the last message was too old to be visible in the hipchat history.

i could workaround the issue by adding a recent message to the ""unused/orphaned"" channel before exporting from hipchat.

the data (i.e. the old messages)  is NOT missing in the export - it's there and it's also there after converting for zulip import. 

i'm curious why zulip hipchat import is silently skipping those older messages - maybe import procedure simply looks if there was recent activity in the channel and only then imports all history/messages to the stream? 

looks like a bug to me. ",devZer0,b'area: export/import question',2019-01-31T09:47:10Z,2020-05-12T19:26:46Z

11332,[wip] bugdown: Optimize regex compilations.,"This commit is only ""wip"" in the sense that it's stacked on top of #11321, which is still wip.  Once that gets merged, my PR can be rebased, and I don't expect conflicts.  (Rohitt might be cleaning up commit messages, and I don't think much else is pending on his end).

@aero31aero did some detailed profiling on the bugdown class, and there are three or four regexes that are expensive to compute.  We had been caching one of those before, but I clean up the code a bit here.  And then I cache a couple more.

In theory Python caches up to 100 regexes, but for whatever reason it doesn't seem to help here.  Also, some of the caching steps here avoid more computation than just the regex itself, as there are extra steps to wrap the regexes with ""^"" and ""$"".",showell,b'size: XL',2019-01-22T19:23:43Z,2019-01-23T16:55:52Z

11301,Fix handling of ctrl+C when cloning a virtualenv,"Our Python dependency management system (https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/dependencies.html) generally does a good job of ensuring that you're always running the correct version of everything if you just run provision.  

But there is a reproducible issue that I've seen:
* Start with a provision virtualenv
* Add a new Python package to requirements/dev.txt
* Run provision
* Hit ctrl-C to interrupt the process while it's installing the packages in the virtualenv via `pip install` (I do this sometimes when I realize I don't actually want to provision in that shell and want to use a different one for it)
* Now run provision again.
* Try to start Zulip using the virtualenv -- this will crash.

What we should do is ""fix"" the broken virtualenv by reinstalling it, but we don't.  We already have a stamp file / manifest system to do a write once virtualenv construction is complete, and `setup_venv.py` checks that the resulting stamp file is in place before proceeding.  From some testing, it appears the problem is that `virtualenv-clone` ends up copying the `success-stamp`.

```
(zulip-py3-venv) tabbott@zaset:~/zulip$ virtualenv-clone /srv/zulip-py3-venv/ /tmp/newve
ls -ltr /tmp/newve(zulip-py3-venv) tabbott@zaset:~/zulip$ ls -ltr /tmp/newve

So probably we just need to remove that file after doing virtualenv-clone, but this needs some careful manual testing that I don't have time for right now, hence the issue.",timabbott,b'area: dependencies area: tooling bug help wanted',2019-01-17T00:38:32Z,2019-02-16T19:26:34Z

11246,Fix Admin UI Bug from PR #10471,"**Purpose of this PR:**
This PR extends upon @YJDave's work from PR #10471 by fixing the bug noted during it's discussion. Thus, this will allow Zulip to have a complete ""Admin UI - Edit Users' Custom Profile Field"" section.

***The Bug Itself (In a Nutshell):***
Of all the custom profile field types, for ""choice fields"" as well as ""URL"" and ""date fields"", when the value is reset/deleted/cleared by the admin in the new _Admin UI_, the frontend would send a null (empty string) value to the backend for that custom profile field (as this is, after all, the new value in this case). This then triggers the backend validators to return an error message.

**The Solution:**
What I did was essentially adopt an already existing solution. What happens when a user ""clears"" their own custom profile field (i.e. choosing no option for a choice field, or giving a blank long/short text field value, etc.) is that a DELETE request would be sent to one of the API endpoints which ultimately ran the `remove_user_custom_profile_data()` method in ""zerver/views/custom_profile_fields.py"". What this method did was remove the custom profile field data for that custom profile field for that user by deleting the CustomProfileFieldValue involved. Thus, taking this as a pre-existing standard, I did essentially the same with when an admin would clear a user's custom profile field.

This PR comes with 2 commits. The first one is a prep commit where I take this common deleting the field value functionality and create a separate method for it (to improve ""DRYness"" and modularity). That method is `do_remove_custom_profile_field_value()` in ""zerver/lib/actions.py"" The second PR is the fix itself where this bug has been eliminated.

11234,Fix scrollbar regressions.,"In between releases, the following commit introduced
a bug where we agressively scroll to the top every
place we call `ui.update_scrollbar`:

    092b73d0b7b45628b463f2ec5594445fe25589d7

The main symptoms were that the left and right sidebars
would go to the top for things like selecting a topic,
getting activity updates from the server, and resizing
the window.  It was very jarring.

The recent commit looked innocuous--the root of the problem
was the original API expressed an intent to scroll to the
top, but didn't actually do it, so it was a bug in hiding.

There are **some** occasions where it's actually appropriate
to scroll to the top, mostly around search filtering, and
in those places we now call the new `ui.reset_scrollbar`
function.

This is a bit of an emergency fix, so particularly with
the settings stuff, we may get more reports of glitches here.

The important thing here is that you almost never want to
reset the scrollTop for sidebars.

11219,Fix handling of duplicate requests to delete a message,"From our server logs, we occasionally see this sequence for users using the webapp, where the the `DELETE` requests are being apparently retransmitted several times to the server in the same second:

```
2019-01-07 23:45:18.583 INFO [zr] IP DELETE  200 155ms (db: 127ms/17q) /json/messages/ID
2019-01-07 23:45:19.069 INFO [zr] IP DELETE  500 640ms (db: 81ms/5q) /json/messages/ID
2019-01-07 23:45:19.069 INFO [zr] IP DELETE  500 641ms (db: 139ms/5q) /json/messages/ID
2019-01-07 23:45:19.072 INFO [zr] IP DELETE  500 643ms (db: 94ms/5q) /json/messages/ID
```

Based on those logs, I'm pretty sure all 4 requests were received by the server essentially simultaneously (i.e. at 18.583 - 155ms ~= 19.069 - 640ms).  I think there's two possibilities for the problem here:

* The click handler logic here is broken, and ends up somehow creating multiple click handlers if you do the right sequence of things.  It seems a bit hard to believe, though, given the chained placement of the `.off()` here:
```
exports.delete_message = function (msg_id) {

```

* The other possible problem here is just that `DELETE` (hard-delete a message) HTTP requests are allowed to be arbitrarily repeated by browsers, caches, etc., and that's what's happening.  This seems a little suspicious, though, because sending 4 requests in the same ~5ms period is pretty aggressive for this feature.

I believe mobile doesn't yet use this API, so we can get away with changing the endpoint at this stage if we think that's use of HTTP DELETE (as opposed to a POST to /delete) is the root cause of the problem here.

The good news is that PIL already handles not crashing the server and provides a nice exception.  However, ideally, we'd catch that exception, return a JsonableError about it being an invalid image, and thus return a 400 type error for this sort of invalid user input.

11212,ldap integration: Don't ask users to set a password when invited,"For users whose email addresses match the LDAP domain (or more generally, servers with only the LDAP authentication backend enabled), we currently have the following dissonant behavior:
* They can just create an account by entering their LDAP credentials on the login form
* If invited to join Zulip, they get prompted to set a password, which is silly because for an LDAP-only organization, these passwords are completely unused.

The invitation feature is useful in this context because one can set the default streams for a batch of users being invited, and set customized welcome email content.  

So we should fix this by making users who click an invitation link in an organization with only the LDAP backend enabled just enter their LDAP username/password to ""login"", but still get the default streams (etc.) experience from the invitation / PreregistrationUser object associated with it.

(I can't recall if we've addressed the similar issue of folks wanting to use Google auth to signup after being invited, but that's probably a related issue)

I believe it happens every time, so as long as you can reproduce the ""Zulip subseqeuntly scrolls"" behavior, you can probably reproduce this (sending a really tall message with the top of the compose box near the bottom of the feed is a good approach).

11079,Fix redis flakes on Ubuntu bionic in circleci,"We've been suffering from an annoying test infrastructure flake for a while, where `redis` doesn't start up properly in Ubuntu bionic like 1% of the time.  While rare, this is a significant problem for the project since CI flakes reduce confidence in CI failures being definitely your fault, and can be really confusing for new contributors to try to debug.  See

https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/43-automated-testing/subject/test.20flake/near/673889 for an example traceback.

I'm not sure we have a good way to debug the root issue of redis flaking, but I think we should do the following:
* Add a check, before test-backend starts, for whether `redis` is running; if it isn't, restart it.  
* Possibly add some logging when `test-backend` fails to check if `redis` is running, and if it isn't, `cat` the redis logs from `/var/log` so we can see if it crashed for a reason.",timabbott,b'area: testing-infrastructure bug help wanted priority: high',2018-12-18T20:18:34Z,2019-05-03T18:35:03Z

@showell I feel like I fixed this bug at some point in the past; the strategy is supposed to be that the we send the color the webapp had picked to the server in the subscribe request, so it knows what color to use.  

My guess is we may have broken this with your recent stream color perf optimization branch; can you investigate?

We should at the very least move them to the left of the time limit thing (and maybe just left-justify them?)

Also, those buttons don't always show up in some configurations.

11033,frontend refactor: Use stream ids to track topic mutes,"In `static/js/muting.js` we currently keep track of muted topics using a `Dict` with the name `muted_topics`, and the key for that is a stream name.

We should change the data structure to be keyed on stream id, which will prevent the client from breaking on stream renames.  Also, in general, we want to use `stream_id` over `stream_name` everywhere we can in the client.  (It's more difficult for some features than others.)

Part of the problem here is that the backend, for legacy reasons, sends stream names in `page_params`.  The backend code generally works in `stream_id` space (good) but changing the `page_params` payload is a bit tricky (we need to not break mobile, basically).

We can defer changing the backend for now.  Instead, just have `set_muted_topics` immediately convert stream names to stream ids during page load.",showell,b'area: left-sidebar bug',2018-12-13T17:22:02Z,2019-07-23T14:17:20Z

11008,emails: Make `ScheduledEmail` code path convert sender into email address in send_email,"This is a somewhat important bug fix for how Zulip's ""schedule an email to send in 2 days"" code path handles changes in the outgoing email configuration in the meantime, which can be quite confusing/difficult for a sysadmin trying out Zulip for the first time.  See #10879 for details.  

The root problem in #10879 was basically that ScheduledEmail objects end up setting the FromAddress value on creation, not at the time they're sent, which means that if you change settings (to fix your outgoing email), we don't actually have a way to update that state for the email system.

Possibly what we want to do is refactor the send_future_email / send_email interface to have e.g. ""NOREPLY"" or ""TOKENIZED_NOREPLY"" be what is included in the email saved in the ScheduledEmail table, and have the substitution for actually sending it happen inside manage.py deliver_email. That would be in line with our general strategy of e.g. rendering the email templates inside the final send_email function. 

This requires a bit of refactoring:
* First, change how tokenized noreply is encoded to have the randomization/substitution happen inside `send_email`, while preserving backwards compatibility.  Probably the right model is to have a new `sender_type` argument to `send_email`, and require either a sender email or a `sender_type`.  If `sender_type` was provided, then we compute the email for that sender type inside `send_email`.
* Then, make `send_future_email` use `sender_type`.  ",timabbott,b'area: emails bug priority: high',2018-12-10T19:14:45Z,2020-03-27T23:44:28Z

Possibly, the root issue is that we shouldn't show guest users streams they used to be subscribed to at all in ""All streams""; they can't interact with them in any way, and it's sorta confusing.  In which case probably the right behavior change is for streams to disappear from that view after a guest user unsubscribes.

The problem here is that this check assumes that if a `zulip.conf` file exists, we're in a production environment:

```
    if (os.access('/etc/zulip/zulip.conf', os.R_OK) and not

```

However, the ""correct"" way to check that, as defined in `zproject/settings.py`, involves reading `zulip.conf` and checking the `deploy_type` attribute, which still preserving the `manage.py` structure of not importing Django libraries like `settings.py` at that early stage.

10929,How to implement a custom authentication backend?,"The documentation is not really helping on this subject:

> To write such an integration, look in zproject/backends.py at the implementation of GitHubAuthBackend, which is a small wrapper around the popular python-social-auth library. You can write a similar class, and add a few settings to control it. To test your backend (which we’d require for a pull request to the main Zulip codebase,) see the framework in test_auth_backends.py. See also our developer documentation on testing auth backends.

I am trying to create an authentication backend that only takes a username (not an email) and a password and authenticates the user on a remote http server using requests.

I've first tried to create a new `CustomAuthBackend(ZulipAuthMixin)` class and add a authenticate function, and also replace all parameters everywhere to use this class be it doesn't find it. And I cannot specify to use username instead of emails for the login.

I've then tried to subclass `ZulipLDAPAuthBackend` with my own new class `CustomAuthBackend(ZulipLDAPAuthBackend)`, and I replaced everywhere `ZulipLDAPAuthBackend` by `CustomAuthBackend`, and I also specified a value for LDAP_APPEND_DOMAIN. And it works now!, I can loggin, but after the successfull connection, I get the following error:

<img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12771126/49118154-282ece00-f258-11e8-8276-84b62e5f4418.png"" width=""350px"" />

When a page (from the user documentation) is resized in response to a smaller width, the righthand side of the sidebar continues to occupy a column of space on the lefthand side of the page.

I think this shouldn't be the case, because:
- It takes away from the amount of space for showing the content of the documentation, and
- carrots and border lines from the contents of the sidebar are visible, which has no use when the sidebar isn't expanded.

10895,Optimize performance of push notifications code in test suite,"If you add a `return` statement at the top of `handle_push_notifications`, running `test-backend test_notifications` goes from taking 4.3s to 3.6s on my laptop.  I suspect there are other tests where we could save significant time as well, but it's hard to run the full test suite that way, because `handle_push_notifications` does useful stuff.

What I'm thinking is that we can/should add an early-return in that function is `push_notification_enabled()` is False, and see if that helps improve the test suite performance.

This issue doesn't require a ton of Zulip background, but it may require some good Python test system debugging skills (the tests that are likely to fail as one works on this involve a decent amount of mocks).

Doing so required the following sequence:
* Submit an incorrect password, generating the ""Please enter a correct email and password. Note that both fields may be case-sensitive."" error from the backend.
* Then, select the password and delete it with backspace.  It's important to do this, rather than deleting all the individual characters with backspace to reproduce appearing the second error on top of the first (though it's likely another bug that we should fix that deleting the individual characters doesn't produce the error).

Probably the right fix is to clear the first/backend generated error when you start editing the password field.

10715,"Android client, UI/usability issues","I have a number of ""small"" bugs I have noticed in the current android client, from the Play Store.

1. If you load up the app, and immediately go to a private conversation, and start typing a message, the client seems to invisibly refresh the window, and wipe out whatever you were writing when it happens.

2a. There is a perceptible lag between showing the ""X new messages"" alert/badge on a conversation, and the messages actually arriving in the chat. 
2b. There is no visual indicator as to whether the client is loading these new messages or not, often it just sits there with the X new message alert showing, and no new messages for long periods, and no indicator or awareness of whether zulip is even trying to load these new messages or not. This is very vexxing when you have poor connectivity.
2c. Even when the messages finally do download, i usually have to scroll down manually to see them (it doesn't auto scroll), exacerbating the problem

IMHO, you shouldn't show a ""new messages"" badge/icon/banner until you _actually have the messages_.

3. When inside a private conversation, on android on the left of the text input box is the + button in a circle. This button, when pressed, will slide out a little draw with more icons in it. There is a UI bug, where the icons that are ""hidden"" actually show through the + glyph while it is ""closed"". This is hard to describe, but fairly obvious when running the zulip app in Dark theme on android. Press the + a few times back and forth and you will see it.

10713,webhooks/github: Handle empty 'requested_reviewers' key.,"We recently received a bug report that implied that for certain
payloads, the `requested_reviewers` key was empty whereas a
singular `requested_reviewer` key containing one reviewer's
information was present in its stead. Naturally, this raised
some not so pretty IndexError exceptions.

After some investigation and generating a few similar payloads,
I discovered that in every case both the `requested_reviewers`
and the `requested_reviewer` keys were correctly populated, so I
had to manually edit the payload to reproduce the error on my end.

My guess is that this anomaly goes back to when GitHub's reviewer
request feature was new and didn't support requesting multiple
reviewers, and that the singular `requested_reviewer` key could
possibly just be there for backwards compatibility or might just
be mere oversight. Either way, the solution here is to look for the
plural `requested_reviewers` key, and if that is empty, fall back
to the singular `requested_reviewer` key.

10672,"API documentation should not mention ""dev server""","Today I noticed a pretty embarrassing issue with our API docs:

The phrase ""Download zuliprc-dev from your dev server"" is really poor in two ways: (1) many of our users use these docs in production, so the ""dev"" phrase is misleading, and (2) it's not obvious at all how to download from a server.

I fixed the most egregious part of this with 8481a2fd2d595e467baa0e88b3990cfe28afd19c, but these remain
* (1) We need to add a macro for the API JS docs like `PYTHON_CLIENT_CONFIG` for the basic setup part, replace that everywhere we use it, and then update it to fix the ""dev server"" reference.
* (2) We should do https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/10670
* (3) If we can figure it out, it'd be awesome to have a link from the common API docs part to the general ""zuliprc"" docs.  But this may be impossible, since it is in a markdown code block after all.  So this is probably a quick determination for whether it's possible and then giving up.

#10438 

This method assumes that it is possible to check the headers of every link pasted in the message field which has an image-like extension. We want to make sure this way of doing this is okay before we continue.
One way of speeding up this by using a cache for link metadata? But we are not too sure what this will look like.

**Testing Plan:** <!-- How have you tested? -->
Ran all of tests/test-backend. 

BugdownTest.test_inline_image_preview_order fails due to a timeout error (when we set timeout to 12 the test passes)
We could fix this by using mock.patch for the link-metadata as opposed to the link contents itself. 

Will write tests for our new function and improve this PR if this implementation looks okay.

10592,"search: Tell user when there are ""no results"" because they used stop words.","Related but not quite the same as #7224.

We have 127 stop words, which includes some reasonably uncommon ones. So if you search for something like ""what about"", we'll return 0 results, since both `what` and `about` are stop words.

This makes Zulip search look broken, especially when you then test Zulip's search by sending a message ""What about .."" and then try searching for it. 

Ideally we would just show a small message like ""x, y, and z were excluded from the search"" somewhere, or maybe strike through the stop words in the search bar.

Implementation-wise:
* We'll need have the data for what the stop words are passed to the frontend, probably via direct addition to `page_params` in `zerver/views.home.py`
* We should add a function in something like `search_suggestion.js` to check if the search terms overlap with stop words
* We add some notice in the search UI (probably in a special error area at the bottom of the suggestions/typeahead dropdown widget?) with the text suggested above.",rishig,b'area: search bug help wanted priority: high',2018-09-29T18:59:06Z,2019-06-24T20:15:55Z

10579,django.db.utils.integrityerror duplicate key value preventing user from logging in,"Hi there,

We are testing a self hosted Zulip server for our organization. One of our users isn't able to login. I'm fairly certain this is due to duplicate key values as stated below in the error.log:
django.db.utils.integrityerror duplicate key value violates unique constraint ""zerver_userprofile_realm_id_email.xxxxxx_uniq""
DETAIL: Key (realm_id, email)=(2, foo@abcdefg.com) already exists

We are using just LDAP for authentication. However, I think the issue may have been created when we were testing email authentication briefly. There's no option to completely remove an account from the server and deactivation doesn't remove the duplicate user key. Any light you can help shed on the situation would be great.

The error is only triggered when a user logs in that previously hadn't logged in. We use our LDAP Server to authenticate the users.

I tried having a look at the code, but at first glance, everything seems fine to me: The `SEND_REMOVE_PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS` setting does exist in `settings.py` and the code should import the correct settings.

The code using this setting was added in commit 
https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/da8f4bc0e956e29b140fa89e963b67e3d23581df#diff-9311e61501fde7dc47af866221b347d1

10314,uploads: Create a placeholder when uploading.,"This PR adds a placeholder when uploading files, so that images are properly placed even if a user keeps typing while they are uploading. The placeholder `[uploading file]()` is used. This is based
on GitHub's handling of image uploading.

Fixes #10305.

10303,custom profile fields: Make minor clean-ups.,"Found a few minor bugs in custom profile fields.

**User Settings**
* [x] For ""User"" type, it looks greyed out, and also if you type afterwards it is in a small font
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/890911/44101794-11849332-9f9d-11e8-9a99-39cd161c66d4.png)
It also doesn't work great for entering more than 1 name, though not sure what the solution should be (the box should expand horizontally then vertically to fit all the names you enter?)
* [ ] For ""Date"" type, it should start at the current day if the field is empty. (To repro: pick a random day from the date picker. Then delete it. Then open the date picker again)
* [x] For ""Choices"" type, I think the top one should be blank, rather than `--Select--`
* [x] Could be followup, but there should be a way to view your profile from this page. 

**Admin Settings**
* [x] For adding a new field, in the dropdown let's rename ""Choices"" to ""List of options"", ""URL"" to ""Link"", ""Date"" to ""Date picker"", and ""User"" to ""Person picker"". In the table they can just be ""List"", ""Link"", ""Date"", ""Person"".
* [ ] When there are no custom fields, it would be nice to remove the table headers at the top:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/890911/44104975-2990fca6-9fa5-11e8-82ae-09623811b6a8.png)
* [x] I think it makes sense for the table to have fixed width for each of the four columns (or rather, width that only depends on the width of the screen, and not on the width of any entered text).
* [x] For ""Field choices"": I think each entry should just have a trash can to the right, and there can be an extra blank row for adding a new field, like
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/890911/44102402-6fe898d2-9f9e-11e8-9bd2-2ef2a4cae388.png)
* [x] The headings (""Text"" and ""order"") at the top of this should go away: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2746074/44106587-ea81f2b8-9fa9-11e8-92a3-4864e941386c.png)

**Viewing profile**
* [x] Viewing profile and then clicking on the Edit icon next to Iago's name gives
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/890911/44102711-3747452c-9f9f-11e8-9516-46548b6b01fd.png)
(i.e. the popover isn't going away)
* [x] Dates should be shown as ""August 10, 2018"" not ""8/10/2018"" since different countries use different conventions for month and day order
* [ ] We show the perfect scrollbar too soon; we should wait to show it until the mouse is closer to the right edge.
* [x] Some visual styling things that could be followup: I think the `x` could be better, and also I think the whole popover could have slightly looser spacing.
* [x] Definitely a V3 thing unless it's easy, but would be nice for the User type to use the pills
* [x] For Last seen: ""Last seen just now"" -> ""Just now"", and ""Unknown"" -> ""More than 3 weeks ago"" or whatever the cutoff is.

As followups:
* [ ] The date picker could use a little better styling; I assume we're just using a library for this, and maybe there are nicer libraries?
* [ ] Minor thing, but I feel ""Date joined"" and ""Last seen"" should be in the top section, where the avatar and name are, rather than in the custom profile fields section.
* [ ] Should timezone be included as another default piece of info shown?",rishig,b'area: general UI priority: high',2018-08-14T16:00:00Z,2018-09-22T06:28:44Z

* http://localhost:9991/#settings/your-account breaks for medium sized label lengths with or without spaces
* We should restrict label length to something (40 characters?) and make sure everything works at that label and hint length.

Also, while editing a profile field, we should advertise the limits. E.g.
* `Hint` -> `Hint (up to 80 characters)`
* The hint input field should stop you from typing once you get to 80 characters

joined more than a minute before.

The bug was due to thumbnails code be not smart enough to handle local files with paths other than starting with '/user_uploads/'. In Zulip we have two type of file paths created by us one being `/user_uploads/` (already worked) and the other one being `/user_avatars/` (required fixing).

To add support for this we needed to add `/user_avatars/` as a local_file type prefix and also make zthumbor/loaders.py understand and add appropriate prefix for the local files directory (more details in commit message of prep commit).

10234,user_groups: Handle non-successful edit responses.,"# Description

Whenever the server replies with a non-successful response after attempting to edit a user group, the settings UI doesn't provide any feedback to the user and remains in the ""edit mode"".

# Steps to reproduce

1. Go to the org settings and create a user group called ""foo"".
2. Create another user group called ""bar"".
3. Try to rename ""foo"" to ""bar"".
4. Nothing happens, but in the background the server has replied that it's not possible to do such modification.

![User group update error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7356565/43851017-d6b0a1e0-9b39-11e8-8c23-9830d1904b6a.png)

# Expected behaviour

The UI should let the user know that something is wrong and the user group couldn't be updated.
#10231 changes the backend's behaviour for this specific case, to reply with a proper message rather than just an internal server error. However, other possible cases must be handled in the UI as well (like keeping a field empty).

10151,[WIP] auth: Force remove session cookies set on root domain for clients.,"This will break the login loops for people who tried login using
github (social auth) and got stuck in endless login loops.
The issue of login loops has been reported to happen on Microsoft Edge
only.
For other browsers like Firefox or Chrome, people seemed to aparantly
get logged out of their sessions on realms (which are hosted on same
Zulip server) when they logged into another realm on same server
using github (social auth). Trying to login back into the realms from
which user got logged out worked fine.

This behaviour difference seems to orginate from the way browsers
arrange the list of cookies to be sent to the server in the headers.
Django seems to maintain the cookies in its Request Objects using
dictionaries with cookie name being used as a key. Therefore if
multiple cookies with same name were sent from browser Django would
retian only one of them and which cookie would be retained would
probably depend on the order they are parsed from the request
headers.

Chrome and Firefox seem to arrange cookies sent in request headers
according to expiry (ascending order). This behaviour makes
logging back in possible because now the expiry of the session
cookie for the subdomain would be greater than that of the cookie
setup by python-social-auth (which was set when user logged into
another realm before causing log outs in the first place).

Microsoft Edge doesn't seem follow the same pattern of arranging
cookies into the request headers. Instead it seems like it always
puts in the cookie setup on root domain at the end. This results
people getting stuck in login loops because no matter what one
may do, once the cookie on root domain is created it will endup
masking other session cookies.

10138,Cross-realm bots lack avatars in /register response,"On `/register` when the `realm_user` event type is included, we return the data for certain users in `cross_realm_bots`.

This is fine and dandy, but they're missing certain information. Most notably, `avatar_url`:
```
$ curl -s https://TESTORG.zulipchat.com/api/v1/register -u [...] \
  -d 'event_types=[""realm_user""]' | jq .cross_realm_bots
[
[...]
  {
    ""full_name"": ""Welcome Bot"",
    ""is_admin"": false,
    ""is_bot"": true,
    ""email"": ""welcome-bot@zulip.com"",
    ""user_id"": 100007
  },
[...]
]
```

In fact, these bots do have avatars set, at least on my test org on zulipchat.com which I used above (on chat.zulip.org, they seem to just have gravatars):
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28173/43509328-3f4784a8-9527-11e8-8f1c-72395c9c82c9.png)

This actually fools the mobile app into not showing these bots' avatars in certain places, though we do in the message list:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28173/43509403-71b634ca-9527-11e8-9e0f-2ab1fdaafb15.png)

We should just start including the avatar_url.

(More broadly, perhaps the cross-realm bots should just be folded into the `realm_users` field of the response; I'm not sure any client benefits from getting them separately. In the mobile app, the separation has been a source of confusion in the code and small bugs; @roberthoenig 's https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/pull/2830 is cleaning some of that up, and will probably end up just folding the `cross_realm_bots` data into the same place we store what we get from `realm_users`. See also #5414.)

10044,Make sure all endpoints the mobile apps hit are properly documented,"Zulip has a pretty well-designed API, with a lot of good properties, but it's documentation is incomplete. 
 The overall goal is to fully document the Zulip API on https://zulipchat.com/api, so that it's easy both for Zulip app developers (mobile, terminal, etc.) and people building custom integrations to understand how to use Zulip's API.  We have documented a few dozen endpoints, but there are many missing.  https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/documentation/api.html is our documentation on how that documentation works (thought it is somewhat out of date, in that we are migrating to using the OpenAPI format file `zerver/openapi/zulip.yaml` for some of the things like argument definitions that used to have a separate `fixtures` file).  Our general philosophy is to build a system that can be extensively unit-tested, so that we can ensure the documentation stays up-to-date as we expand and adjust the Zulip API .  Some good tasks in this area include:
* [ ] Document a few endpoints.  Read 69da22d998c6f5f56931c8449f441b3fc114d59f as a recently added endpoint to refer to.  I've noted a few that seem like good starter items here.
   * [ ] Document messages/${messageId}/reactions, the endpoint for adding emoji reactions
   * [x] Work through the ""user groups"" endpoints mentioned below
* [ ] Contribute to https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/12521, which has a bunch of coding tasks
* [ ] Once one has done a few, update `docs/documentation/api.md` to correct the parts that are out of date.  (This is https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/12571)

I'm very happy to provide help and support to folks working on this area.

------------------------------------------------

A good priority for doing this is to make sure we document all the endpoints that we need to use in the mobile (and terminal) apps, just because that's API documentation that will be readily and frequently consumed.  

Here's the current list of endpoints the mobile apps interact with that don't have API docs, organized somewhat by priority.

Below are things that are not documented, and should be:
* [ ] /messages/${messageId}/reactions
* [x] /typing
* [ ] /users 

Accessing uploaded files:
* [ ] user_uploads

User settings for notifications:
* [x] settings/notifications (https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/10342)

Presence:
* [x] users/me/presence (core presence endpoint)

Starring and unread counts endpoints:
* [x] mark_all_as_read
* [x] mark_stream_as_read
* [x] mark_topic_as_read
* [x] messages/flags

------------------------------

I believe the app doesn't support editing these organization settings.  Further, it should be just getting these data from `/register` with the right `event_types` value, so it's probably a mobile bug if we're accessing these:
* [x] realm/emoji
* [x] realm/filters
(Unless I'm wrong and the app supports managing user groups somewhere secret?)
* [x] user_groups/create
* [x] user_groups/${id}
* [ ] user_groups/${id}/members
* [x] users/me/user_groups

Same story with these stream settings/deactivation (though I could imagine changing these):
* [x] streams/${id} -- does the app actually support administering streams this way? 
User stream settings (color, notification settings, muted topics; does the app support administering these?): 
* [ ] users/me/subscriptions/muted_topics
* [x] users/me/subscriptions/properties

And these user-level settings:
* [ ] users/me/alert_words


-------------------------------------------

This endpoint is mostly just for mobile/desktop to get organization icon, but has some use beyond mobile/desktop:
* [x] server_settings

These are used only by mobile, so potentially lower priority for main API docs:
* [x] dev_fetch_api_key
* [ ] dev_list_users
* [ ] fetch_api_key
* [ ] users/me/android_gcm_reg_id
* [ ] users/me/apns_device_token

Already documented, I think (unless it's a different method):
* [x] events
* [x] register (Ignoring documentation of the full data format, which is its own issue)
* [x] messages
* [x] messages/${id}
* [x] messages/${messageId}
* [x] users/me/${streamId}/topics
* [x] users/me/subscriptions
* [x] streams

This PR has a series of commits to fix #9982 with extensive CSS/JS refactoring.

1. Previously, there was a bunch of complex JS attempting to smoothly keep the currently active stream row visible in the subscriptions modal (such as in the case of automatic keyboard arrow navigation). By switching to use the `scroll_util.scroll_element_into_container` method, we can eliminate that. 
2. The CSS overlays in the app (informational, settings, drafts, subscriptions, invites, etc.) all used differing styling. This commit attempts to normalize it a bit by using the same DOM structure and responsive width.
3. Overlay size changes cause considerable issues for subscription modal
stream row scrolling calculations because all stream rows are half
of their supposed height when the scrolling calculation method is
initialized.
4. The `scroll_util.scroll_element_into_container` method failed to account for padding in the stream rows, leading to miscalculated scrolling. Using `innerHeight` instead of `height` solved the issue.",synicalsyntax,b'area: stream settings bug has conflicts size: XL',2018-07-22T04:10:38Z,2019-01-17T18:48:09Z

9934,Add LDAP based authentication method in the development environment,"One of the more common classes of bug reports in [#production help](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/31-production-help) is users having trouble getting LDAP authentication working in production servers. Part of this is because LDAP is one of the more complicated third-party things (there's several pieces of configuration the user needs to provide).  

But part of it is also that fairly few developers are able to help to debug these, without having a LDAP server setup locally.  It would be really nice to have a way to gain the benefits of having an LDAP server setup in the development environment so we can try to reproduce what issues people are facing and help with fixes.

To make this work we can use the fakeldap library to fake ldap server in development environment and have some mock data returned to requests to the server. We already have plenty of reasonable unit tests using fakeldap.  Ideally, we'd be able to just change a few values in `dev_settings.py` to enable LDAP authentication in development (and pick which one of the 3 modes we document in `prod_settings_template.py` the user wants), and that LDAP authentication would just use `fakeldap` (or maybe something fancier like `mockldap`) to return data from a minimal fake LDAP database for doing manual testing/debugging.",adnrs96,b'area: authentication area: testing-infrastructure priority: high',2018-07-12T12:09:51Z,2018-08-09T20:55:37Z

9901, test_fixtures: Fix bug with run_db_migrations for test platform.,"In this commit we are fixing a kinda serious un-noticed bug with
the way run_db_migrations worked for test db.
Basically run_db_migrations runs new migrations on db (dev or test).
When we talk about the dev platform this process is straight forward.
We have a single DB zulip which was once created and now has some data.
Introduction of new migration causes a schema change or does something
else but bottom line being we just migrate the zulip DB and stuff works
fine.

Now coming to zulip test db (zulip_test) situation is a bit complex
in comparision to dev db. Basically this is because we make use of
what we call zulip_test_template to make test fixture restoration
after tests run fast. Now before we introduced the performance
optimisation of just doing migrations when possible, introduction of
a migration would ideally result in provisioning do a full rebuild of
the test database. When that used to happen sequence of events used to
be something like this:
* Create a zulip_test db from zulip_test_base template (An absolute
basic schema holding)
* Migrate and populate the zulip_test db.
* Create/Re-create zulip_test_template from the latest zulip_test.

Now after we introduced just do migrations instead of full db rebuild
when possible, what used to happen was that zulip_test db got
successfully migrated but when test suites would run they would try to
create zulip_test from zulip_test_template (so that individual tests
don't affect each other on db level).
This is where the problem resides; zulip_test_template wasn't migrated
and we just scrapped zulip_test and re-created it using
zulip_test_template as a template and hence zulip_test will not hold the
latest schema.

This is what we fix in this commit.",adnrs96,b'size: S',2018-07-06T14:48:29Z,2018-07-11T14:32:00Z

""I attached the file to the ticket `#123`"", we have set up a custom filter to autolink
the pattern `#<number>`.

![2018-07-04-140225_537x117_scrot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8974561/42258998-70a35ef8-7f99-11e8-8286-3a3feca080a7.png)

### Problem

Autolinking does not work if (non-white) characters are prepended to the pattern
(e.g. 'abc#4000').

This behaviour feels very clumsy for us, particularly because we normally communicate
in a language (Japanese) where words are generally not separated by spaces.

For an example, we often say something like:

> ""チケットは`#4000`です"" (trans: ""The ticket is `#4000`"")

... and Zulip fails to notice the pattern in the sentence.

### Desired Behaviour

Realm filters should work for patterns with leading characters.",fujimotos,b'area: markdown area: settings (admin/org)',2018-07-04T06:01:50Z,2019-01-28T22:49:42Z

9849,Initial feedback from initial on-premise integration,"Hi, I recently integrated `zulip` (via `docker-zulip`) in our on-premise network, and everything seems to work nicely so far 😄 
There are certainly features missing that we would like, some of them will be taken care of by the next release (GJ guys, seriously).

Here's a summery of features/questions from the first couple of days:

### Default streams based on profile fields

I think this is something that will be amplified by the `custom profile fields` feature in the next release.
Say I have users from Active Directory, using the LDAP Authentication backend. At the time of registration, I can already know stuff about them, like where they're assigned in the organization, and so on.

I think that this information can be used to effectively assign default streams to people, alongside the ""unconditional"" default streams.
Say I have someone who belongs to some group, which is something I can filter with respective AD fields.
I may have a stream for each possible group, and have someone automatically assigned to streams based on attributes from AD.

This can be really nice for large companies, I believe.

### Remove necessity for the email suffix when `LDAP_APPEND_DOMAIN` is set

I'm not sure if this is me not setting `zulip` up correctly, or just a bug - I'd suppose that if I have that setting, people wouldn't need to specify the whole email address, just their username.

### Basic RTL support for message content

This one seems pretty easy, if we're just looking at messages. We've also looked at `Rocket.Chat`, and they seem to have a bit better RTL support than zulip. We saw in the chrome devtools that one thing that sets `zulip` and `RC` apart is that the `div` that hold the message content in `RC` has `dir=""auto""`.

We've added that manually to messages in `zulip`(see [single message template](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/master/static/templates/single_message.handlebars#L70)), and it seemed to work better.

### CAS Authentication support

The friend of mine who checked `Rocket.Chat` out, showed me that it supported something that's called `CAS` authentication. This is mostly for Windows users, as browsers can automatically supply authentication data from the user connected to the computer (given correct certificates set up by default in `Internet Explorer`, exposes the `REMOTE_USER` env variable). This f.e makes it possible for our windows users to enter Microsoft's TFS without even supplying a username and a password.
This is all done automatically. Now, this is more of a nice to have, I can live without it, but if you guys can actually make it possible, it's a plus for all sides, since other people and companies can use that feature.

### Ability to append the users of a `User Group` to a stream

Pretty basic feature I believe, if someone can add a person to a stream, why can't they just supply the name of a `User Group` and batch invite the entire group?

### Notification that a message has been read

I know this is a pretty huge feature to implement, but it has been brought up a couple of times. Similar to `Whatsapp`'s blue ticks, it can be useful to know if a message has actually been viewed by the other side, or read by the entire group (if it's a group chat).

____________

So this pretty much sums it up. I'd like some feedback on those features, and I guess that individual issues will be opened if needed.

9848,Integrations: Improvements to dropdown menu behaviour on docs home page.,"In this PR we have commits which migrate integrations docs page to use font awesome 4.7 prefixes and fixes buggy behaviour around the categories drop down and its alignment relative to the integration lozenges.

Below I attach a number of pics relating to the alignment improvements I did. I am gonna attach pics for the page in different resolution as it would look after merging this PR rather than doing an old vs new on the images. I am not attaching screens at some resolutions (of course each screenshot represents a change in resolution level in the sense what we define using media queries) because things around the drop down don't change at those levels.

9834,email notification of mentions leaks private stream's prior messages to new member,"**Observed behavior:**
1. I was added to a private stream.
2. The person who had added me sent a message to that stream, mentioning my user account with @.
3. As expected, I could not see any prior messages in that stream; the first one was that welcome message.
4. I received an email to let me know I had been mentioned on Zulip.
As is typical with ""mention"" notifications, the email included about 5 previous messages in addition to the one where I had been mentioned.

**Zulip version at the time:** 1.8.1

**Concern:**
I don't think people are relying very heavily on the assumption that message history is invisible to new members of locked streams, but this behavior could surprise people who have that assumption.

**Suggested behavior:**
Perhaps have a stream setting that defaults to not providing message context for mentions on private streams.
Another option is to apply whatever filtering is being used to prevent users from seeing private stream messages prior to when that user was a stream member to filtering the message context in ""mention"" notification emails.

9832,"widgets: Fix empty message_content of ""All messages"" widgets.","Well, there were different cases of the empty content of widgets.
Like, when we first load the page with the home screen (""All messages""),
the widgets appear and they still appear even when narrowed to
stream/topic, but things went wrong when again narrowed to
""All messages"".
Another case was when a new widget is created in narrowed stream/topic
but this doesn't appear in ""All messages"".

But amusingly the fix was this simple, that jQuery isn't doing smart
things when a jQuery object is passed to `.html()` which wasn't
expected at all, so we have to pass the HTML string of `widget_elem`
to `content_holder`.

## Other commits

Given the various scrolling problems reported in #8887 and #9748, @akashnimare and I worked together to search for replacements for perfect-scrollbar. [simplebar](https://github.com/Grsmto/simpleba) was discovered to be a suitable alternative; however, the scrollbars were mispositioned because the scrollbar content's parent div elements had padding that wasn't accounted for by the package (see Grsmto/simplebar#90 for why upstream decided against fixing the bug). Therefore, I refactored the CSS to have the parent elements not use any padding, which allowed the scrollbars to be positioned correctly and allow us to successfully migrate to simplebar.",synicalsyntax,b'size: XL',2018-06-21T05:28:30Z,2018-07-13T16:59:33Z

9755,message view: Refactor message CSS to eliminate fixed positioning.,"A lot of the current styling for the message box heavily relies on fixed widths and positioning, resulting in undesired element mispositioning or overflows in narrow screens. By switching to a flexbox layout, the message view is more flexible on differing screen widths. (Note: There are various other elements that still have fixed positions, but I'm hoping to get feedback on these changes first before moving on to fixing others)

Like the blocks in the previous Apps/API/Integrations section, we add 2 pseudoelements to standardize the width of feature blocks so that the last block shares the same width as all previous blocks.

Note: It's possible to fix this without pseudoelements by setting media selector breakpoints that control the default width of elements according to screen size. But since this hack was already previously used above, I wasn't sure if this was supposed to be the advised way to fix it.

9721,"search: Fix ""Enter to search"" while using an input method.","(This is one of the nastiest bugs I've faced(maybe because I've to read complete searching mechanism code which I think is the thing I can keep with me :) and come up with this hack-y solution, not sure whether this is the best solution possible but I tried to explain it as much as possible) 
NOTE:   To test this locally I've used Google Chrome input tool.
        This change will not affect users who don't use input tools.

Here is the algorithm used to deal with this case and other important
points:

* Here I've used `compositionend` event which is triggered
as soon as an input tool completes a word or user press ""enter""
to get the suggested text. (There was a situation where it is
triggered even when input tool wasn't closed, that is when we
press space, but it also triggers another `compositionstart`
event simultaneously so our logic can't be affected by this.)

* We are using a variable `is_using_input_method` which sets to
`true` when `compositionend` event is triggered.

* Basically our searching is initiated by `keyup` event which
is triggered by the same keypress which triggers `compositionend`
event to get the text, so our main goal is to suppress the searching
triggered by this key pressing.

* Observation shows that `compositionend` is triggered before the
`keyup` and calling of callback `narrow_or_search_for_term`
used by typeahead.
    i.e. chronological order of triggering of this event is
`compositionend` > calling of `narrow_or_search_for_term` > `keyup`.

* So the main logic is to set `is_using_input_method` to `false`
by default and if used the input tool then when we press enter
to get the suggested text we set it to `true` which indicate
further events triggered after it to skip the searching and
finally, in `keyup` we set it to default `false` so when pressed
enter again we have it set to false and we have a successful
search.

Fixes: #9396.

9685,Attachments: Fix handling of stream history.,"    attachment: Fix handling of stream history.
    
    This fixes two issues:
    
    * Our upcoming guest users feature needs to not give guest users access to public stream
      attachments even if they couldn't access the public stream.
    
    * After a user joins a private stream with our new shared history
      feature, they couldn't see images uploaded before they joined.
    
    We need to test this change for two major things:
    * Those two cases need good unit tests
    * We need to look at how many database queries are used in the various
      cases for that second model.  This function gets called a lot, and
      we want to keep it fast.

```

This is pretty annoying to fix, because if you do the proper `Integer()` cast for Puppet 5 (what we have on Bionic), it's invalid syntax on Puppet 3.4 (for Trusty), and so puppet 3 prints an error (even if you put it inside a conditional for the distro).  It's possible that the right answer is to fix the warning on bionic and just deal with trusty printing that error (assuming Trusty would still run properly), but it'd be great if we can find a better solution.

Because in both cases it's a parser error, this issue does not seem to be responsive to conditionals.",timabbott,b'area: production installer bug',2018-06-05T15:08:47Z,2019-08-09T23:29:50Z

9616,css: Fix code block formatting issues in our Markdown docs.,"@timabbott: I tracked down the bug (and fixed it but only partially so) but I ran into a few other concerns:

* Rendering code blocks as `inline-blocks` increases their line-height (try opening `deploying-bots.md` before and after this change to see the difference). But I can't decrease the line height because that affects all code blocks, including multiline code blocks whose line height should ideally be larger than their inline/non-multiline counterparts.

* You will notice that the code blocks do not take the full width of the paragraph they belong to and are only as wide as the content inside. I tried very hard to fix this but I couldn't, simply because all code blocks get affected by a `width: 100%` setting. So, `<p>Here is one <code>element</code></p>` and `<p><code>multiline code block that occupies the same paragraph with no content outside the code tags</code></p>` are both affected equally. The former example's `<code>` block shouldn't have `width: 100%`. But it is really hard to use CSS to distinguish between inline code blocks vs. multiline code blocks.

* I notice that our ""fenced code"" extension renders code blocks as `<div class=codehilite><pre></pre></div>` blocks but it doesn't work for when the code block is inside a numbered list. At some point we should probably rewrite the extension to also carve out code blocks inside numbered lists and render them in a similar fashion.

* As for the `p:not(:first-child)` change, please see [this commit](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/da4ac38e372388dac7fdd600748c4d2fbac26d36#diff-596f742ad1a85ee9cfdfd8c35ea88057) and its commit message as to why this ""workaround"" is necessary across our Markdown docs.

These are just some things I came across while tackling this. I am by no means a CSS expert (I'm not even moderately competent at CSS), so I think at some point we might want to have someone more experienced make a follow-up to this PR! Thanks!

9608,export: Ensure zulip->zulip export covers all tables that should be exported,"I just completed the TODO project we'd for a long time had at the top of `ALL_ZERVER_TABLES` (well, now it's `ALL_ZULIP_TABLES`) to validate the list of tables that we export against the list of tables that are actually present; see 42aea68df3cc9e58c8e8ac857aab5bc36022129a.  I suppose this probably increases the priority of making sure we call `sanity_check_output` in CI (or at least refactor so the first piece is run there).

Aside from that bit of tooling work, the TODO list of things to fix is this:

```
    # The fact that these are not exported is a bug
    'zerver_botstoragedata',                                                                                                             
    'zerver_botconfigdata',                                                                                                              
    'zerver_mutedtopic',                                                                                                                 
    'zerver_realmauditlog',                                                                                                              
    'zerver_pushdevicetoken',                                                                                                            
    'zerver_service',                                                                                                                    
    'zerver_usergroup',                                                                                                                  
    'zerver_usergroupmembership',                                                                                                        
    'zerver_userhotspot',                                                                                                                
```

A few of these are larger projects (like `botstoragedata` / `botconfigdata`), just because we may need to add some to `populate_db` to make testing it convenient.  But I think most of these are pretty straightforward and we should just aim to fix quickly.  Some notes:
* user groups are present in populate_db
* hotpots are present in populate_db
* muted topics are easy to make in the UI
* realmauditlog entries are easy to make, but this one make require a bit of work just because of its foreign key pieces.
* push device tokens might need to be made manually (see `test_push_notifications.py`).
* `service` comes from making an outgoing webhook or embedded bot

And then medium priority is to also take along the analytics tables:
```
    'analytics_fillstate',                                                                                                               
    'analytics_realmcount',

9580,Markdown: fix overlapping highlight of alert words and mentions.,"Added regex to the process_message function so that anything
in a span tag (which represents a mention or an alert word

And also prevents usernames in mentions from being
highlighted, since they are also contained in span tags.

For the last commit:
The blueslip warning mentioned in #3380 were from paths ending at people.email_list_to_user_ids_string. Some additional blueslip warnings
were raised after using that function.
Although we can put a validation check somewhere in the call stack of
people.email_list_to_user_ids_string, this function itself is used to
validate the operand by the higher order functions,so it wouldn't make
sense to put a  validation check before that. Instead, removing the
blueslip warning altogether was chosen.
people.email_list_to_user_ids_string was replaced by
people.reply_to_to_user_ids_string which is a blueslip-free version
of the same. Other blueslip warnings were removed.

The original issue mentioned
> considering things with spaces in them if and only if the thing after the : is an exact prefix of someone's name.

I think that will not be necessary in this case as we are using only emails for filtering. If it's not an exact prefix, e.g `sender:Kin ha`, the prefix check would enable to make the suggestion `Sent by Kin, search for ha`. But since `Kin` is not a valid email, it's of no use and any query following it would result in empty search. The result without the prefix check would be `Sent by Kin Ha`. Thus, I think it's better to skip this check and (presumably) save some time.

The provision process unfortunately pulls out the big hammer when it comes to re-populating your database with fresh data using all the latest migrations.  This is safe in some sense, but it can be super annoying if you've taken time to carefully craft test data for some difficult bug repro or you have API keys in config files for bot testing, etc.

We should consider a slightly less aggressive stance toward doing database migrations.

9488,Add support to `run-mypy` for using the mypy daemon,"mypy 0.600 introduced support for `dmypy`, a way of using mypy that can substantially speed up typechecking. 

The daemon can be invoked with `tools/run-mypy -d`. It will be automatically started if not running and will automatically restart on version or configuration changes.

This adds support for using taking advantage of that mode. A few preliminaries were necessary:
 * Daemon mode requres using `local_partial_types = True`, so set that flag and fix the problems it causes
 * Daemon mode only supports `follow_imports` values of `error` and `skip`. This is annoying, but switching to `error` shouldn't cause much trouble, since `run-mypy` ought to find all of the sources.
 * The control interface for dmypy that shipped with 0.600 was kind of lacking, and faced with Zulip needing a bunch of glue logic to use dmypy, I went and implemented a mode of launching that daemon that I ought to have built for the 0.600 launch in the first place. Additionally, some of my testing against the Zulip code revealed dmypy crash bugs, which needed to be fixed. As a result, we need to upgrade mypy to a current development version.

I've done some manual testing, though nothing exhaustive.

This doesn't take advantage of mypy caching to speed up cold starts, since currently the cache would need to come from a local non-daemon run, and there has not been much validation on using the daemon on caches generated by runs that produced errors.",msullivan,b'size: L',2018-05-21T23:23:27Z,2018-05-22T05:42:08Z

9455,tools: Allow optional arguments after file arguments in test_backend.,"Fixes #9233.
Uses nargs='*' instead of nargs='argparse.REMAINDER'.
nargs='argparse.REMAINDER' gathers remaining terms as arguments
even if it is an option e.g --coverage, while '*' gathers all the
command-line arguments until the next option is encountered.

From https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#nargs:
-  '*'. All command-line arguments present are gathered into a list.:
```python
>>> parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
>>> parser.add_argument('--foo', nargs='*')
>>> parser.add_argument('--bar', nargs='*')
>>> parser.add_argument('baz', nargs='*')
>>> parser.parse_args('a b --foo x y --bar 1 2'.split())
Namespace(bar=['1', '2'], baz=['a', 'b'], foo=['x', 'y'])
```
- argparse.REMAINDER. All the remaining command-line arguments are gathered into a list. This is commonly useful for command line utilities that dispatch to other command line utilities:
```python
>>> parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='PROG')
>>> parser.add_argument('--foo')
>>> parser.add_argument('command')
>>> parser.add_argument('args', nargs=argparse.REMAINDER)
>>> print(parser.parse_args('--foo B cmd --arg1 XX ZZ'.split()))

9396,"typeahead: ""keydown"" events for Enter and Arrow keys should be ignored while ""composition""","First, I describe what is the ""composition"".

In CJK language regions, people use some software named ""IM"" (input method) to input heir local language text. For example, when I search a Japanese term ""日本語"" (means ""Japanese language"") in a Zulip instance with Firefox, I need to do:

 1. Click the search field.
 2. Activate the IM. The ""composition"" session starts.
 3. Type keys: `n`, `i`, `h`, `o`, and `n`. (in a composition session)
 4. Hit the Space key to convert the text to Japanese term. ""日本"" is suggested. (in a composition session)
 5. Hit the Enter key to determine the text ""日本"". (in a composition session)
 6. Type keys: `g`, and `o`. (in a composition session)
 7. Hit the Space key to convert the text to Japanese term. ""語"" is suggested. (in a composition session)
 8. Hit the Enter key to determine the text ""語"". (in a composition session)
 9. Deactivate the IM. The ""composition"" session ends.
 10. Hit the Enter key again to search ""日本語"" on Zulip.

While the composition session, ""keydown"" events for special keys (Enter and Arrow) are handled by the IM to choose a term from variations or determine the choice. Thus I hit the Enter key three times in this case. The first time and the second are notified only to IM, so Zulip receives only the third time.

And, there is one problem on lately development build of Firefox.

 * [1446401 - Start to dispatch keydown/keyup events even during composition in Nightly and early Beta](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1446401)
 * [Intent to ship: Start to dispatch ""keydown"" and ""keyup"" events even if composing (only in Nightly and early Beta) - Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/oZEz5JH9ZK8/discussion)

Due to the change, now development build of Firefox (aka Nightly) notifies ""keydown"" events to the webpage, for all keyboard operations while ""composition"" sessions. As the result, the search field shows suggested results while I'm typing alphabet keys. This is good improvement, but there is one new problem: when I hit the Enter key to determine a chosen term, it is also notified to Zulip. Thus, when I just determine the first part term ""日本"" of the joined term ""日本語"", Zulip unexpectedly handles the Enter key to search the part ""日本"" and I cannot input following part ""語"" anymroe.

To fix this problem, Zulip need to ignore keydown events for Enter and Arrow keys while the composition session. While a composition session, all keydown events have the [`isComposing`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/isComposing)  property with `true` value, so you just need to return when the property is `true`. Could you apply this change to Zulip?

Needed feedback about:
* Up to what precision we want to handle floating point value as there are various problems in converting minutes in decimal to seconds and vice-versa beyond a single floating point. Currently, I've limited it to one floating point.
* I guess there should be a minimum value below which we don't need to set edit limit like don't allow value set below 10 sec and maybe we should enforce this in backend and frontend both, thoughts? 
* There is a small bug if the limit is set to <0.05 it get converted to 0.0 and automatically set to ""Any time"". This bug will get fixed once above point is addressed. 
* How we want to show pure integer time: 100 or 100.0

What we should do is translate the HTML `<blockquote>something</blockquote>` tag that we generate in Zulip into a `> something\n`, instead of ""something"".  Or if we can't get that working in a way that feels good because of issues around newlines, just hide the `<blockquote>` content entirely.

9210,Improve logic around populate_db needing to be rerun with settings changes,"With 656f882a44b2a29414aafe22d724a09c493f1468, we made a change to `INTERNAL_BOTS` in our settings, which did not trigger a `populate_db` regeneration, and cause confusing test failures.

To respond to that, we added 2bc51931a882fa396af979ee76fa71de3278b053, which adding all the settings files to the set of data that we inspect when determining whether or not we need to re-build the database.  This has had the unfortunate side effect of the database rebuilding a lot more often when running our various test suites unnecessarily (e.g. due to settings comment changes).

I think we could do considerably better by replacing that list of files with just a few values like `INTERNAL_BOTS` read from the `settings` object that are actually accessed inside `populate_db`, rather than looking at the entire files.  

This would normally be a reasonably high priority project, since this is an issue that ends up wasting time for developers.  However, I'm going to start by reverting 2bc51931a882fa396af979ee76fa71de3278b053, since the settings-change bug it was fixing was much less bad than the performance issue, which drops this to no longer be an urgent issue.

9144,narrow: Fix narrowing behavior when loading a new tab.,"In the very early days of Zulip, we didn't have unread counts; just
the pointer, and the correct behavior when opening a new tab was to
place you near the pointer.  That doesn't make any sense now that we
do have unread counts, and this corner case has been a wart for a long
time.

This commit does the main behavior change here.  However, there's a
bug we need to fix, where we might end up trying to pre-render a view
of the narrow based on the `all_msg_list` data before `all_msg_list`
is caught up).  We need to fix that bug before we can merge this; it
should be possible to determine that using `FetchStatus` on
`all_msg_list`, or with better performance by using the `unread_msgs`
structure to determine whether the message we should be selecting is
present locally.

Fixes #789.

----------------------------

For testing this and working on the outstanding bug, the test procedure is this:
* `manage.py populate_db -n2000` 
* `manage.py mark_all_messages_unread`
* Login as Iago, pick a stream/topic pair, narrow and hit end in that narrow to mark as read.
* Reload.

Before this change, you'd be placed at the first message to that topic ever.  With this change, you get placed somewhere random that appears to be the bottom, and then a fetch from the server adds a few more messages below where you're placed.  Correct would be to be placed at the very bottom.

I made some notes on fixing the remaining issue above.  I believe what we need to do is as follows:
* For the on-reload case, first (correct but potentially not optimized version), just unconditionally do a fetch from the server when doing rendering.  I have an idea for how to do this that I'll try in a commit after getting home.

9143,Buttons to add emoji/file/call to a message have no label,"The buttons to add something to a message have no label and might be unusable for screenreader users. For example:

`<a class=""message-control-button icon-vector-paper-clip"" id=""attach_files"" href=""#"" title=""Attach files""></a>`

Normally, the title might be used as an accessible label if there is no link text. However, since the icon seems to be displayed using some unicode character, it counts as the link content and the title is discarded. We could solve this by adding an aria-label with the same content as the title. The only problem with this approach is that the label might be read twice if users have a screenreader that reads title attributes for links.

Besides the label, I think that a button element should be used here instead. The use of `href=#` usually is a red flag that a button might be more appropriate. This is important for example when using speech recognition and giving a command like ""click button video call"". If the button is not a button, the speech recognition software will not be able to find this.",bramd,b'accessibility bug',2018-04-18T23:01:02Z,2020-08-14T22:49:56Z

9087,Eliminate annoying frontend race conditions involving i18next,"Since we added i18n to the Zulip frontend, we've had frequent issues with JS code trying to access translated strings before they are loaded.  I'm aware of at least ~5 current minor bugs, and there's a lot more that have in the past been fixed using `ensure_i18n` hackery that makes the code hard to read.

The crux of the issue is that `i18next` works by fetching the `translations.json` file for the target language from the Zulip server, asynchronously from loading javascript.  So if `translations.json` for the target language isn't cached, then we won't be able to render strings inside the JS codebase.  The current fix is to use `ensure_i18n` to basically defer setting those components up until i18n is ready.  But it's kinda a game of whack-a-mole.

A better, permanent solution to this category of problem is as follows:
* We modify the home() view code to encode the `translations.json` content for the user's language (if not English) into either `page_params` or perhaps a parallel `translation_data` data structure.  Since Django is already computing the language to use for the backend, there's no real extra logic to add here.
* We hack up `i18next`, somehow, to read its translation data from the `translation_data` structure.  Conveniently, we're already doing the parsing for our `transifex` integration in backend code, so worst case we can replace `i18next` entirely with our own hack with similar syntax.

Once that's done, I think we should be able to do the following:
* Have a bunch of JS bugs disappear magically for us.
* Remove all of our logic around caching i18next data in browser local storage.
* Remove `ensure_i18n` and all the initialization order hacks and funny function arrangements related to it.  
* Rejoice!

@umairwaheed do you have time to do some initial investigation into how hard the ""hacking up i18next"" part of this plan is?  It seems like we might be able to just use this: https://www.i18next.com/how-to/add-or-load-translations#add-on-init.

In theory, this should Just Work, in that we use `Message.objects.bulk_create` to import the data, and that's the same function we use to send messages in Zulip.  The mechanism we use for full-text search updating is a postgres trigger on the Message table, combined with the `process_fts_updates` job to process the inserted messages (which `run-dev.py` runs).  I'm not sure whether the problem is that the postgres trigger isn't running, or `process_fts_updates` isn't processing the messages.

8994,Work on eliminating the pointer as a user-facing concept,"It's increasingly clear that we'd be better off without the ""pointer"" as a user-facing concept.  Here are some notes on work to do here:
* [x] We need to fix the corner cases around narrowing and local echo in #8989, which is potentially a blocker for the next item.
* [x] We can use https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/4120 or similar to replace the `furthest_read_time` logic in `zerver/views/home.py`.
* [x] We should fix this corner case bug with local echo: https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/14017
* [x] We will need to get server-computed unread counts running in production.  This was blocked for a long time on downwards scrolling in narrows.  I'm not sure whether it's actually essential to this project, but it might be, and it's certainly easier to reason about potential problems this change could cause with server unread counts done.
* [x] We should review https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/pointer.html and change the code paths that still use the pointer there that are noted with ""We plan to change"".  The ""narrow in new tab"" code path should be straightforward to change
* [x] the ""all messages view"" piece may require more thought (see notes below and https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/pointer.html#new-all-messages-view-high-watermark).
* [x] The pointer is used for a few things in Zulip.  First is where we load the main webapp to.  For that, we should consider using `use_first_unread_anchor=True` for the initial query to the server, rather than using the `pointer` as the anchor.  Doing this change may require some secondary changes to `message_fetch.js` to reflect the fact that we learn the current effective pointer a bit later.  It's possible we'll end up wanting the `pointer` field as a place to cache the last `first_unread_anchor` that we computed to optimize the backend query (with a `>= pointer` sort of condition on the query).  I guess there's also a question of whether we want to do this logic in the `home()` view or the `get_messages_backend` view; the former would be more of a drop-in replacement.
* [x] Next, we need to change what happens when you hit `escape` to un-narrow to take you to the first unread message left in the home view by default.

I think it's possible the correct conclusion of this effort would be that ""pointer"" is still a value that we keep track of for optimizations and such, but isn't a user-facing concept.  ",timabbott,b'area: message view priority: high',2018-04-06T16:07:43Z,2020-07-03T23:00:32Z
8989,advanced: Suppress local echo until narrows complete.,"This is probably an issue that @timabbott will assign to somebody with some expertise on our narrowing codepath.

When we narrow to a topic, it's possible we haven't fetched all records from the server, and if that's the case, we generally want to suppress local echo and drop incoming message events on the floor, since they're gonna be out of order and probably offscreen anyway, and we generally are about to get more messages from `message_fetch.load_messages_for_narrow`.

The only quirk in this is that even though the server is ""behind"", we may have enough messages in our local cache (basically `message_list.all`) that we were able to advance the user to the actual last message in the feed.  And then if we suppress local echo and/or drop messages on the floor, it's basically a bug.  (The user can jiggle the scrollbar to trigger a new fetch, but it's a super confusing experience.)

The basic problem here is that when you narrow, this sequence can happen:
* you pre-populate the message list w/local messages that you know about that match the narrow
* you ask the server for the definitive list (which can include edge case messages like messages that happened when you were unsubscribed)
* you advance the pointer to the first unread message
* the server responds with messages matching the original anchor, and it correctly tells you it has more messages to fetch
* we don't fetch new messages until you scroll to the bottom
* the user sends a message, and if we had logic in place to suppress local echo, we'd think we're behind when we're really caught up (at least onscreen)

The solutions here are probably one of the below (or perhaps a hybrid):
* do a second fetch if we advance the pointer
* make the first fetch more aggressive if our local knowledge indicates more than 50 messages will match the narrow
* advance the pointer forward **before** setting the anchor for the first fetch
* make our scrolling-based triggers for fetching be more aggressive

In some ways the title of this issue is misleading, because it's not so much that we want to suppress local echos here, it's more that we want to ensure the integrity of our onscreen data when we narrow.  But the title kind of reflects the history here.

8988,zjquery usage while testing,"Currently zjquery behavior differs significantly from actual jquery so the pattern of setting it as a global sometimes causes bugs. One such example is using the jQuery selector $(selector, $container). zjquery will go ahead and ignore the second argument and create an element if one does not alrady exist with the selector argument.

I spoke to @showell about this and he mentioned that most of the time zulip developers prefer to use a stricter version of the jquery syntax such as $container.find(selector) instead. This doesn't really sit well with me since such behavior is not documented in the testing section of the docs. The other aspect of this is it doesn't really make sense to limit application code because of some limitations of a custom coded testing utility. I also found that as a new dev to the project the learning curve for testing was kind of high because of the strange API this module provides as opposed jquery itself.

I can see two ways of addressing these issues:

1) Better document zjquery, how it should be used, what are the corner cases where it fails as opposed to jquery and best strategies for testing using it etc.

2) Go ahead and encourage the use of jquery in combo with jsdom for node-side testing. The node tests are really quite fast at this point. Not sure how much overhead adding jquery and jsdom to each test file would add.",armaanahluwalia,None,2018-04-06T10:38:46Z,2018-04-06T11:28:01Z

8979,Fix bugs with deactivating a recently renamed stream.,"Here's the original report:
https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/9-issues/subject/Red.20Error.20Message.20appeared.20when.20deleting.20a.20stream.20(Minor)/near/555251

What I can reproduce is that if you do the following:
* Rename a stream in ""Manage streams""
* Go to ""manage organization"" -> ""Delete streams"" and delete the renamed stream

Then we throw an exception in the development environment with ""Stream deactivation canceled due to non-matching fields."" as the error, coming from this code path:
```
        if ($(""#deactivation_stream_modal .stream_name"").text() !== $("".active_stream_row"").find('.stream_name').text()) {   
            blueslip.error(""Stream deactivation canceled due to non-matching fields."");                                      
            ui_report.message(i18n.t(""Deactivation encountered an error. Please reload and try again.""),                     
               $(""#home-error""), 'alert-error');                                                                             
        }                                                                                                                    
```

The actual bug here is that we should be using stream IDs to refer to streams, not their names.  I think if we fixed that, this whole conditional could go away.

I think `blueslip.error` may be more fatal in development than production (i.e. it may stop execution), which is why I didn't see the `ui_report.message` here.  

The secondary bug is that the `ui_report` call here shouldn't be using the `#home-error` element (see the chat.zulip.org thread for how this looks); it should be displaying in an element in the settings form.

This is broken, since a `../` based structure is correct for handling i18n (rather than just doing `/#settings`; e.g. for /de/login), but it's only correct on the /integrations pages (Where we have /integrations/doc/github, e.g.), not for use on other pages like `/help/message-a-stream-by-email` with a different number of steps from the root.

We could potentially just move to e.g. `/#settings`; the alternative is to do something that actually looks at the URL structure.  I think I currently favor just moving this to e.g. `/#settings`, since we're not translating /help/ pages anyway.

8958,get_messages: Fix interaction between include_history and use_first_unread_anchor,"@borisyankov helped me discover a subtle bug where `use_first_unread_anchor` and `include_history` don't interact correctly in a situation where the only messages on a topic were before the current user subscribed to that stream.  Basically if you set things up like this:
* Send a single message to a new topic ""test"" to a public stream Hamlet is not subscribed to (""Denmark"" in this example).
* Subscribe hamlet to that stream
* Do the API query the mobile app does to try to view topic ""test"". (e.g. stream Denmark, topic ""test"", use_first_unread_anchor=True, anchor=0, num_before=25, num_after=25).  Then the API query will return 0 messages (!).  So effectively one sees messages in the webapp, but none appear on mobile.

Here's how this happens:
* Because `use_first_unread_anchor` is True, we end up going down the non-`include_history` code path in `get_messages_backend` and thus joining with UserMessage.  The user has 0 rows for that topic in UserMessage (since they weren't subscribed when the message was sent), so everything from there on returns no messages.

What we should actually be doing is in `get_messages_backend`:
* The main query should just be on `Message` (i.e. we should get rid of the `and not use_first_unread_anchor` part of the `include_history` line)
* In the `use_first_unread_anchor` code block, we should check `include_history`, and if True, we do the join against UserMessage in constructing `first_unread_query`, since we do need that join for getting the first unread message ID (just not for fetching the messages themselves, i.e. no changes to the main query).  This should require a moderately sized refactor.
* The rest of the code path correctly splits the logic based on whether `include_history` is True (i.e. does a UserMessage query to splice in the `flags` data as needed).

@showell since you were just in this code, would you be up for tackling this in the next day or so?  Ideally we'd have a fix in before the 1.8 release (aka Monday).

8941,Double click select scrolls large multiline message to bottom,"With [large, multi-line messages](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/94-bot-testing/subject/testing/near/553990), double clicking text at the top (which normally selects a word and then line) scrolls the stream to the bottom of the message instead of performing a select action.

To replicate: 
* Find a [long, long message](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/94-bot-testing/subject/testing/near/553990) and click the expand button 
* While staying at the top of the message, double click to select a word OR double click and drag to begin a drag selection, starting at the start of the word
* Witness the stream immediately scroll to the end of the message

Expected Behavior:
* Don't scroll

Thoughts:
What's happening probably has nothing to do with double clicking- and everything to do with that first click. When you click on a message that is longer than the current window, Zulip will scroll the window to the bottom of that message. This makes a lot of sense if the message is only a few lines longer than the current window. The behavior is unintuitive [here](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/94-bot-testing/subject/testing/near/553990) because it ends up scrolling the start of the message out of the window, and makes it impossible to double click to select (which works fine if the bottom of the message is visible).

to track down.

Previously, if payload['push']['changes'][i]['closed'] was True,
we assumed that a branch was removed. Looking at whether `closed`
was set to True or not was our way to tell whether a push removed
a branch or not.

However, this is wrong! `closed` being set to True can also mean
that the pull request associated with the branch was approved but
the branch itself was not deleted. According to the BitBucket docs,
the correct way to see if a branch is deleted is to check if `new`
is null.

This bug was leading to KeyErrors about not being able to find
the `commits` key, which shouldn't happen anymore!

8865,org settings: Move function out of setup function. ,"This just moves some functions out of `_setup` function because they are unnecessarily initialized at the setup time.  These functions were inside `_setup` function because in past we have `property_types` inside `_setup` which contains some translation string but those strings are removed so we don't have these function and JS objects inside `_setup`.  

Also, there are some minor fixes for bugs in commits,
**org settings: Make sync_realm_settings to be available at load time.**

This moves `sync_realm_settings` function out of `_setup` so that
we can call `settings_org.sync_realm_settings` without opening
settings page atleast once.

This also fixes a minor bug in which if we have two tabs opened and
in one we haven't opened settings page at least once and in
another we change an org setting, then we get an exception in
the former tab because of the event as `sync_realm_settings`
isn't defined yet.

**org settings: Fix real-time sync for realm_waiting_period_threshold.**
This fixes a minor bug in which the value of `input` element of
`realm_waiting_period_threshold` don't get updated because in
`set_create_stream_permission_dropdwon` we don't change the
value of the input.
So, this minor refactor handles this more carefully.",shubhamdhama,b'size: XL',2018-03-29T12:22:23Z,2018-03-29T15:03:30Z

Within a stream, upload a file using the paper clip icon. You will see a blue bar with blue text ""Uploading..."" but it gives no progress.

**Justification:**

Well, progress bars are useful right?  Especially for larger files.

8861,compose: Prevent input from being selected after tab change.,"The stream and topic inputs are sometimes fully selected after the user changes tabs and then switches back. To fix this, remove the jQuery `focus` listener on the inputs so that the same amount of text (or no text) is selected before and after a user switches tabs. Also, completely remove `select_on_focus` because it is not used anywhere else.

See [discussion on this issue](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/9-issues/subject/Topic.20autoselect.20on.20tab.20change/near/503595).

Fix #8414.

8858,Race condition with soft deactivation,"I saw this exception in production for a user coming back from soft-deactivation.

I think what's happening is that he attempted to load the Zulip browser, noticed that it was taking a long time (backfilling a ton of UserMessage rows, probably), and then tried to reload.  This of course resulted in two copies of the job running at the same time; the second one loses the race and 500s.  

I think basically the root problem here is that we need some sort of interstitial ""loading..."" state for users who've been soft-deactivated for a long time.  Ideally, we'd display a page that has (1) a loading indicator and (2) some sort of explanation about how they've been away for a long time and we're calculating all their unread history.

That, or we should implement the cron job that we discussed for the original soft-deactivation feature, to call `add_missing_messages` for all soft-deactivated users daily.

8855,Fix exception when updating bot permissions.,"**settings: Fix exception on updating bot_creation_policy.**
This initializes the bot_creation_policy_values after the page
is loaded.

Previously we initialize these values in `settings.js` when settings page
is loaded at least once, so if we open two tabs, one(1) in which we
haven't opened the settings page yet and if in another tab (2) we
update the `bot_creation_policy` value, then because of the event
which calls `settings_bots.update_bot_permissions_ui` causes exception
in (1) because `bot_creation_policy_values` isn't initialized yet.

Fixes: #8852.

8854,Exception in set_message_offset when removing selected message in a narrow,"There's a few ways to reproduce this exception:
(1) Mute the last topic in a stream.
(2) Edit the topic to move all messages in the current topic to a new one.

In each case, we end up calling `rerender_preseving_scrolltop` in a situation where the currently selected message ID is going to disappear.  The eventual exception happens in `set_message_offset`, where it tries to preserve the scroll position of the selected message that no longer appears in the narrow.

This is probably going to be a difficult bug to fix correctly, but it's also a fairly common JS exception, and I worry about releasing with it still present.

8853,Exception when browser learns about a deleted message it didn't have locally,"This exception I saw in production error reporting only, but the cause is clear from reading the code:
* A browser receives a notification from the server about a message having been deleted that had not been locally cached by the browser (e.g. because it was older than the batch of ~1200 messages the browser fetches from the server, or was on a stream the user had just subscribed to (but not narrowed to!) and the message had been sent before the user subscribes).

In that case, `message_store.get(message_id)` will return undefined, since the browser doesn't know about the message yet.  Then `unread_ops.mark_message_as_read(message);` will throw the below exception.  Were execution not stopped here, we'd also have a problem with the `topic_data` calls on the following lines.  I think the correct fix is probably to just (1) we should be calling `unread_ops.process_read_messages_event`, not `unread_ops.mark_messages_as_read` (the latter function only being correct for marking a message as having been read by this browser), and for the `topic_data` thing, I think for now it would work to just do nothing, but once we switch to server-managed unread counts, we'll want this code path to still call the `topic_ops` function.  So I think that means we want to change the `delete_message` event sent from the server to include the recipient data for the message (type, and (stream_id, topic) or (PM recipient user ID list)) required to do this correctly in the absence of the brower being able to look up the message.

8845,markdown-tests: Two minor changes for ease of development.,"## Commit 1

Show the testcase name for easy debugging. Sample output:

```
AssertionError: Failure in test: safe_html_unclosed_tag_and_quotes
Actual and expected output do not match.  Showing diff
```

## Commit 2

Allow ignoring certain tests while debugging when you just want to test against one test at a time, or similar usecases, where you'd be tempted to remove the whole testcase from the JSON file. Both the approaches carry similar risk: forgetting to add that testcase back/removing the `ignore: true` part. This approach, however, can be tested for using another test added here.",aero31aero,b'size: M',2018-03-28T07:23:20Z,2018-03-29T00:37:13Z
8843,Improve exception handler for BugdownRenderingException,"Currently, if we have a BugdownRenderingException, we send an email to admins with an exception report that just contains a sanitized version of the input in question, e.g. this:

`Failed message: '[xxxx](xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

`

This block  in `zerver/lib/bugdown/__init__.py` contains the logic in question:

```
        if len(rendered_content) > MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH * 2:

```

I believe we don't use our standard exception reporting logic in `zerver/logging_handlers.py` and `zerver/lib/error_notify.py`, in large part because those can end up sending a Zulip message by `ERROR_BOT`, and we really don't want that to happen with a Bugdown exception, since that could throw the same exception in the exception reporting code.

But we want to have the other nice features of `error_notify.py`, especially the data about which user got the exception (so one can contact the user).  

So I think there's two reasonable options for how to improve this:
(1) Go through the normal `logging_handlers.py` handler code path, but check the exception class in there, and use that to suppress the ERROR_BOT code path.  With a unit test, this should be pretty safe.
(2) Call the `error_notify` functions directly, passing in the arguments needed.  The thing I don't like about this is that it seems liable to break over time if/when we extend the `error_notify` API, but that could be fine with a good test.

Tagging this as a priority, since it makes debugging markdown exceptions feel unattractive as a project.

8841,Exception when adding multiple Android PushDeviceToken objects with the same token,"We're most likely seeing this exception because of https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/issues/2128. 

What I suspect is happening is the flurry of duplicate requests to register for push notifications at the same time end up racing with each other and trying to create duplicate entries.  

However, I think there's a deeper bug here: if a user has accounts with multiple organizations on zulipchat.com, it appears that the Android app will use the same `token` for each of those apps.  So I think we need to change the `unique` constraint on `token` in the PushDeviceToken model to instead be a unique constraint on `(token, realm_id)` (or maybe just not exist, since there are testing reasons, one might want to have multiple accounts in the same realm and access both from a mobile device).  

We got rid of a similar issue for the push bouncer in 735b49e505112798dbd4f7f6380b0cf0eecc40d8, though I think that fix probably shares this problem of multiple realms hosted on the same RemoteZulipServer installation; that's just a lot less common than the zulipchat.com case.

8838,Service bot code leads to database queries in loop for organization administrators,"I saw in our server logs on chat.zulip.org that my own account needed about 300 database queries to load the home view.  This is a clear sign of database queries in a loop.

Some debugging determined that this is a regression only for organization administrators, which is how it was missed by our existing test (which uses a non-admin user).  

Further debugging showed that the queries are being done in `get_owned_bot_dicts`, which calls `get_service_dicts_for_bots` in a loop; the latter does a database query.

This is a classic case where we just need to do a bulk query for these data.

I merged 5404edaf0377cded36f95360e940dbb98324c3dd adding a test showing the too-high query counts to help ensure after we fix this, it never regresses again.

Tagging as a release-blocker, since this can be a major perf issue for org administrators.

8818,org settings: Fix real time sync.,"*Commits for real-time syncing:*
**org settings: Refactor the discard changes function.**
This extract the logic of resetting the value of a single property element
at a time so that we can reuse this for real-time-syncing.

**org settings: Handle dependent sub settings manually.**
This replaces the previous logic of triggering change() event.
(Also, when we trigger the change() event whole path for detecting
changes in a subsection are triggered which isn't good.)

**org settings: Add real-time syncing for property changes.**

*Minor bug found during changes:*
**org settings: Fix discard changes for realm_create_stream_permission.**
On discarding changes made for `realm_create_stream_permission` always
""by_admin_user_with_custom_time"" get selected because
`create_stream_by_admins_only` isn't a valid page_param.

*Small refactor:*

**org settings: Use disable_sub_setting_onchange for dependent checkbox.**
This makes use of `settings_ui.disable_sub_setting_onchange` for
handling dependent `id_realm_disallow_disposable_email_addresses`
checkbox when `id_realm_restricted_to_domain` is changed.

*I want to know how does this below commit sounds to you because when I found that this function should be extended I can only figure out the cases for success_continuation. So my point is rather than using this function for custom `success` function I think one will directly make a call using `channel.post` to prevent complexity in providing arguments.*

**settings_ui: Revert extension for success callback in do_settings_change**

This reverts success callback extension for `do_settings_change` function
because it seems it is better to make the request directly rather
than calling `do_settings_change`.
And hence `error` callback extension is also removed  for the same
reason, but a error_continuation is added to do additional tasks when
errors happened.",shubhamdhama,b'size: XL',2018-03-25T14:38:52Z,2018-03-25T15:56:14Z

8779,parse_user_agent matches all strings,"The regex `^(?P<name>[^/ ]*[^0-9/(]*)(/(?P<version>[^/ ]*))?([ /].*)?$` matches the empty string with `name`; and since version is optional (but can include linebreaks) and the last group catches everything but linebreaks, there is always a match at [lib/user_agent.py line 8](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/master/zerver/lib/user_agent.py#L8). 

This means that `match` is never `None` so:

* The [TestUserAgentParsing test](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/master/zerver/tests/test_decorators.py#L1327) is futile (since it will trivially pass as `parse_user_agent` is never `None`)

Also, nowhere currently uses `user_agent['version']`.

I think the only option for fixing this bug it to use stricter RegEx (making the version required, or preventing `name` matching with the empty string). Changing the guard conditions from `match is None` can always be done by changing the RegEx pattern, which is cleaner.

- Cancel button fades out if user removes the changes manually i.e without clicking the cancel button.
- Clicking on cancel button discards the changes and the user group returns to its original state.
- Suppose you've made a change to the name, clicking on the description edit or pill input of the same group does not save that name, but if you click 
any input that is not present in the current group, then that change is saved before allowing the user to edit the second group.
- Solved: If user has added 1 user and tries to add another user (the 1st user is unsaved), then as typeahead is outside the input box, blur event is triggered resulting in the saving of 1st member which wasn't the intention.

When we edit a user group's name or description, it is disappearing due to the fact that 'members' is already a dict when user_groups.add is called from the editing function, so the add function fails and it does not get added to list when groups are populated. We fix by checking if 'members' is an Array, if yes, then we convert it to dict, otherwise not. Also, when we fix this issue, the edited group is going to the bottom, it is not staying at its position, so to fix this we sort by ids of the groups to maintain proper relative order.

stream settings: Fix error in real time sync for subs add/remove event.
    
    Currently, our realm time sync for subscription add and remove
    action is throwing error, cause subscription is add/remove twice.
    
    Fix this by removing the functions call for updating UI in
    frontend, and let the subscription event handle this, which
    it already does.

stream settings: Don't show add-subs-btn if user can't add subscribers.
    
    Even if realm admin can access unsubscribed private stream subscribers,
    admin can't add subscriber to stream. Hide the option to add subs to
    stream in UI.

tests: Use iago user in case of admin in `attempt_unsubscribe_of_principal`.
    
    In `attempt_unsubscribe_of_principal` function in `test_subs.py`, use
    iago user if `is_admin` is true, instead of making the hamlet user
    an admin.

8695,Fix administration of subscribers for private streams,"Following up on #8361, we have a few bugs in administration of subscribers for private streams:
(1) Realm administrators don't get the initial subscribers for private streams they're not on from the backend on page load; this means that subscriber lists start empty even if the stream actually has subscribers.  

(2) The real-time sync mostly works, in that if you add a new subscriber, they show up, but it appears that somehow a second copy of the stream gets created in the stream list when a new subscriber is sent:

For fixing (1), I think it's possible we want the webapp to do a `GET /.../members` query when you click into the stream, rather than maintaining the data for every stream, but probably the simplest solution would be to just send subscriber data for all streams down in the initial requests for realm admins.

The `server_events_dispatch.js` code for hotspots calls `hotspots.load_new()` -- which suggests that we only implemented showing the next hotspot, not dismissing older ones.  One can check the `events` data structures sent via the JS console, but my read is that `do_mark_hotspot_as_read` sends the list of hotspots that should still be visible on a change, so the browser should be able to diff that list with whatever was before, and hide any that are no longer in the list (i.e. have been dismissed).

(Read the ""new feature tutorial"" if you're not sure how this stuff works).

8654,stream settings: Fix subscribers not showing on private stream creation.,"Fixes:

- [X] Fix subscribers not showing on private stream creation.

Previously, stream subscribers were not rendering correctly. Due to
following reasons:
- Subscribers list didn't get initialized
- Subscriber members template add subscriber-list-table DOM element
  conditionally, which doesn't handle case if user have access to
  subscribers later.
- [X] Fix sub-unsub btn not showing on private stream creation.
- [X] Fix display of stream subscribers count


Fix this by cleaning subscriber member template to hide the
elements, instead of conditionally adding DOM elements and
initialize subscribers list even if user can't access subscribers.

8607,Improve webhook defaults for where messages get sent,"There's two related features we'd like to implement across our webhooks:
* Having a default of sending a PM to the bot owner if a stream isn't specified, rather than using a default stream name.  This is a behavior change, but should be fairly obvious to users, so I don't think we need a detailed migration for this.  But it should be helpful for making it easy to test the webhook setup process without needing to pollute a public namespace (create a stream, etc.).
* Supporting the user overriding the topic chosen by the bot by passing `&topic=foo` on any of our incoming webhooks.

As a strategy for this, I think we basically need to replace the default `check_send_stream_message` call at the end of our webhooks to send a message to the stream, with a more flexible function that can interact with the request variables provided in the request.

I think the function should look very roughly like this:

```
@has_request_variables                                                                                                    
def send_webhook_message(request, body, topic, stream: str=REQ(default=None), param_topic: str: str=REQ(""topic"", default=None)):
    if param_topic is not None:
        topic = param_topic
    if request.stream is not None:                                                                                        
        check_send_stream_message(request.user, request.client, stream, topic, body)                                      
    else:                                                                       
        # TODO: assert the bot has an owner.  I think that shouldn't be possible without a bug elsewhere.
        check_send_private_message(request.user, request.user.bot_owner, ""**%s**\n%s"" % (topic, body))                    
```

and then the call would look like `send_webhook_message(request, body, topic)`, where `topic` is the topic that was computed inside the integration.

A few other advantages of this refactor include:
* No need to interact with `request.client` inside the webhook view, which was unnecesary complexity
* Removes a lot of duplicated `has_request_variables` code for the stream/topic names in the `def` lines for webhooks.

@eeshangarg does this make sense to you?  I think to start on this project, we should build that method in something like `zerver/lib/webhooks/__init__.py` and convert 1-2 webhooks to use the new method (with appropriate adjustments to tests), and then we can convert the rest (and also think about docs updates to report these two features -- at least changes to both the tutorial and the docs macros for the integrations themselves).  

This is a fairly high priority, since it should have a pretty significant impact on how complex the process for adding a new webhook in Zulip.  ",timabbott,b'area: integrations priority: high',2018-03-06T23:00:25Z,2018-03-16T18:39:19Z

8597,Clean function to update message-topic-edit-pencil.,"<!-- What's this PR for?  (Just a link to an issue is fine.) -->
This PR cleans the function to update message-topic-edit-icon in message row header. 
Following issues/tasks are addressed in PR:

**static/js/settings_org.js: Rename func which updates msg-topic-edit-pencil.**
    
    Rename `toggle_allow_message_editing_pencil` to
    `update_message_topic_editing_pencil` in `settings_org.js`.
    As this function update the pencil icon for updating message
    topic in message row header.

**message editing: Clean update msg-topic-edit-icon function.**
    
    `update_message_topic_editing_pencil` function update edit
    icon for message topic in message row header.
    
    - Remove erroneous `meta.loaded` check.
    - Add proper check of message editing permission in realm
      before updating message-topic-edit-icon in function.
    - Update `always-visible-topic-edit` element in function
      simultaneously.

 **message editing: Move update msg-topic-edit-icon func to `message_edit.js`.**
    
    Move function `update_message_topic_editing_pencil` to file
    `message_edit.js` from `settings_org.js`.

 **message editing: Fix bugs in `recipient-row` template rendering.**
    
    In `recipient-row` template, if conditions to add/hide/show edit
    icon for message topic is incorrect.
    In some cases, we only want to just hide the edit icon, but icon
    should be in DOM, cause in future if organization settings are
    changed we want to show edit icon in message row.
    
    If user can edit topic of message, surely add edit icon element to
    DOM regardless of user is allowed to edit or not. If user is
    allowed to edit then show edit icon otherwise hide edit icon element.


**Testing**
This is the ideal behavior, for message-topic-edit icon in message row header:
- Messages which doesn't have any topic should have ""always visible edit icon"", if message editing is allowed in org.
- Admins should have ""on hover visible edit icon"" for all messages, if message editing is allowed in org.
- All clients messages rows should get updated on change of org setting, without reloading browser.",YJDave,b'size: M',2018-03-05T19:50:54Z,2018-03-08T04:36:37Z

8585,Fix local echo marked.js implementation of emoticon translation,"The new emoticon translation implementation from bdb86f1b5ed745c5023e311d9cd960bcbc164190 doesn't correctly handle whitespace in the frontend markdown processor.  As a result, the local echo is wrong for messages containing potential emoticons (e.g. `a:)b` will get translated to emoji by the `marked.js` implementation; it should not be).  While fixing this, we should clean up how the marked.js unit tests work to cover this well; I think some tests will want to enable/disable the setting.  

Since it's a new optional setting that's default-off, I've elected to merge the feature despite the fact that this doesn't work.

Very soon, and regardless before a release, we should either fix the marked.js implementation to match the backend or disable the feature, since the local echo emoticon translator is sufficiently buggy as to cause bad interactions with things like pasted URLs.",timabbott,b'area: emoji area: markdown bug priority: blocker',2018-03-04T23:38:22Z,2018-03-28T00:21:37Z

My guess is that when a user is changed to be the admin of a bot (and thus the bot enters that user's bot data), that user doesn't get an event telling the client that the bot exists before they get an event telling them about the bot's new owner.  Or something like that.

8546,Problems uploading certain image files as avatars,"I suspect that this is a bug that will be chased down to our not having installed some library that is needed for PIL to handle these types of PNGs.  I'd start working on this by reading the PIL documentation for what files it can handle.  I don't have a sample actual file handy, unfortunately.

I think there's 2 things we need to do here:
(1) Make the error handling for this case a nice error message, not a 500.
(2) Ideally, make this file type work.

This is a somewhat challenging task requiring some research into Python libraries (and maybe some investigation to find a PNG that uses this feature), but it doesn't require special context on Zulip.

I think (A) if we have a limit on size, a limit in the UI layer is important (e.g. a limit to the text field size), and one only at the database level is crazy and (2) I'm not sure a 100 character limit makes sense.  I think we should probably just switch the database table to TextField so that we have some freedom to manage this just at the UI and Backend layers, and then set a reasonable limit on length in the UI.

8474,Errors searching for characters in Unicode code planes above Latin Extended A,"The report below is for Firefox v.58.0 and Chrome v.63.0.3239.132, both on Mac OS 10.13.2.

1. On the Recurse Center instance I searched for the character `無` (U+7121), which I know is present in some posts. No hits are returned, and I get the error:

   > Unable to connect to Zulip. Updates may be delayed. Retrying soon...

   over and over, and the circle around the Z logo turns constantly. But at these times I can search for regular ASCII text in another browser tab and get hits back without difficulty. So the error message is inaccurate and must have something to do with something specific to the failed search.
   
   After I send the request, the browser's URI field shows binary encoding of the UTF-8 value of 無: https://recurse.zulipchat.com/#narrow/search/.E7.84.A1. Normal URL quoting format would be `%E7%84%A1` rather than `.E7.84.A1`, but I suppose Zulip has its own ways. Manually changing the URL to use `%` instead of `.` returns empty results.

2. I also tried searching one by one for some other non-ASCII strings that I know are in a post:

    * lǎomóu
    * wěishàn
    * fēiwén

   Like 無, the characters `ǎ`, `ě`, and `ē` in these strings are all not only non-ASCII but their codepoints are above the Latin Extended-A code plane, so they're a good test. In Firefox only fēiwén is found; the other two give me the same error message as before. Chrome finds all three. The highlighting of the found strings is off, as per #7021, but that's a separate problem.

3. I tried sending myself a message containing combining characters:

   ```
   m̥ o̦ n̑
   ```

   Both Firefox and Chrome succeed in finding (and correctly highlighting) the pairs of ASCII and a combining character; neither can find the message in question if I submit just the combining characters alone.

    case 'delete_message':

We should also be clearing any unread counts related to that message (effectively marking it as read; though we need to be careful, as the message might have already been read).

A secondary thing we may need to do (but I wouldn't block resolving the first issue on finishing this, since it's much less user-visible as broken) is removing the topic from the recent topics data structures if the last message in that topic was deleted.

    input field, which results in garbage or falsy value in input field.

    previous error message still shows up on top of setting page.
    Cause organization-settings div element, which is used for error
    reporting, is common to all settings tab in org settings section.
    
    So hide this error element when user click to other section/tab of org
    settings, cause we don't want to display alert messages of previous
    setting tab.

**create stream: Fix real time sync bug in private stream creation.**
```    
    If new private stream is created by realm admin without realm admin

The favicon and title agree with the sidebar: both show 4 unreads, and the favicon alternates showing the ""person"" icon.

I actually have a second tab -- something I don't usually do -- and I read the messages there, and it has the correct count (there's 1 genuine unread, in a stream):
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28173/35658470-4c56c0e6-06b6-11e8-9057-8ba897408cdf.png)

Since noticing this situation, I've gotten several more PMs in the same thread, and read them in that same left-hand tab that I read the others (and replied). Each time, the messages make both unread counts go up; and when I read them on the left, both go back down. The one on the right stays 3 too high.

OK, and in the tab with the stuck unreads, I just went to PMs. It immediately went to a specific message, which promptly became read (and the count updated accordingly). That message had been edited, which is interesting in light of #7229.

The next message received in that thread was also unread -- but not edited.

The next was already read.

The next was also unread, and not edited.

See also #8042. Unlike both #8042 and #7229, though, the unread flag and count promptly updated when I went and looked at the messages -- the issue is that when I read them elsewhere first, this tab didn't get/understand that update from the server.

Hitting the Page Down key again, or Down, or scrolling up a bit and then back down, all have no effect; no spinner appears, and no more messages load. The message view behaves exactly like this is really the latest message in the stream and there's nothing else to see.

The sidebar is right, though -- it shows the actual most recent topics:

As the sidebar (correctly) also shows:
* I was already fully caught up in the stream;
* I have the stream muted.

Then: if I hit `s` to narrow to the stream, the app promptly loads a bunch more messages, and scrolling to the end now takes me to the genuine end.

After I first saw this, I tried the whole thing in a new tab and it reproduced exactly.

I've never seen a bug like this before (and a good thing that is!), which leads me to guess it's related to the stream being muted. @showell, do you have any thoughts on where it might lie or how to debug?

8177,"message view: EXIF orientation is ignored, causing images to look rotated","(@gnprice:) Here's a [nice description of the issue](https://help.gigsalad.com/article/117-fix-rotated-photos) from a different webapp, complete with instructions for how to fix it as a user:

* The cause:

  > You may notice that sometimes when [posting a photo on Zulip] that the image is not rotated correctly. This is not a bug [in Zulip]! Rather, this is a fairly technical behind-the-scenes issue that involves the photo's orientation meta data and a web browser's inability to interpret it. [...]

  > Cameras, especially those on mobile phones and tablets, have built-in orientation sensors that assign special rotation information to every photo they take. Behind the scenes, this tells other apps what the correct rotation angle should be for that photo. In other words, your photos are actually taken and saved sideways but then extra orientation meta data specifies a rotation angle for correctly displaying the photo. When you view that photo in your phone's gallery, or in an app that understands the orientation meta data, it appears as if the image is rotated properly when it's actually not. Unfortunately, web browsers [don't] honor orientation meta data. This is why a photo might appear sideways after it has been uploaded [to Zulip].

  Sad but true. Some phones prevent this problem by rotating the actual image data, but many (even many recent, high-end phones) do not.

* How to fix it for your photos:

  > To make sure that a photo will be displayed properly in web browsers the best option is re-save the photo with proper rotation and without orientation meta data. On a mobile device, you can often achieve this by opening a photo and rotating it 360 degrees or until it appears correctly then re-saving it as a new photo. Alternatively, you could save a slightly cropped version of the same photo. You could also download the photo onto a desktop computer and adjust it using the basic photo apps built into OSX and Windows (both called Photos) or an advanced photo editing program such as Adobe Photoshop or Lightroom.

We should also develop a solution that fixes photos up automatically, so people don't have to do it themselves. More on that below.

(@gnprice's technical description, following the investigation below:)

By default in a JPEG photo, the pixels around coordinates (0, 0) -- i.e., the first pixels in the file -- go in the upper left. Many devices produce JPEG files that start somewhere else. These contain some metadata, in the EXIF format, to say something like `orientation=upper-right`, meaning the pixel at (0, 0) goes in the upper right instead of the upper left. This means any software displaying the photo needs to respect that metadata; if it doesn't, the photo will come out wrong, e.g. rotated sideways.

Unfortunately, while a lot of software does respect EXIF orientation metadata, the web does not. Specifically, an `<img>` element in HTML ignores it. The result, given we don't do anything to deal with this, is that these photos are shown sideways in the Zulip webapp, desktop app, and most of the mobile app.

Devices that produce photos with this problem include some phones, but not others, from each of Apple, Samsung, and Google; also some phones from Motorola and probably other vendors; probably some standalone digital cameras too, but nobody in these threads has tried one. Reports of this issue have referred to uploaded photos in messages and to user avatars.

To fix this, we'll need to inspect uploaded images (including user avatars) on the server at upload time to extract the EXIF orientation metadata. Then we can do either of the following:
* Normalize the orientation to `upper-left`, rearranging the pixels as needed. (A [Medium post](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/the-dumb-reason-your-fancy-computer-vision-app-isnt-working-exif-orientation-73166c7d39da) linked below has example code to do this in Python, using PIL.)
* Convey that metadata to the client (perhaps in a `data-` attribute on the `img`?) so it can apply a CSS transform to fix the orientation.

For more detail and background, see https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/8177#issuecomment-534310596 below, and the comments after it.

(original report:)

quoting a conversation:

A: my pictures come in sideways when i upload them, even when they are the correct orientation

B: If they are coming from a phone, this might be a matter of browser support. The image is rotated, but has metadata that specifis the correct orientation taken from the phone's gyro. Browser not respecting this metadata might result in the issue.

C: I remember hearing about something crazy that iPhones specifically did here -- like if you go and rotate them in the built-in camera app, it just does something in some idiosyncratic metadata that Apple's stuff all pays attention to.

D: Yeah this happens w iPhone metadata and browser uploads. Just detect the orientation by width vs height and make sure it's not rotated.

E: This is relevant:

8025,Handle quoted-mention edge cases properly.,"If somebody does a quote-and-reply to a message that has a mention, and they leave the mention inside the quoted portion, Zulip currently behaves as if the **new** message also mentions the original mentioned person.

This was probably never an intentional decision, as the naive implementation doesn't distinguish whether the message is in quoted section.

The current behavior is somewhat defensible in some cases.  If somebody mentions me, and then another person replies to the message that mentions me, I may want to know about both parts of the conversation.

If I reply to myself, that's a bit different, since I obviously know about the message, and the primary use cases that we know about for self-mentioning are a) testing mentions works and b) marking a message as something to come back to, but neither of those use cases is really necessary when the first message is already mentioned.

We have to make a decision here:
* just ignore this, and let folks work around the self-mention issue
* only fix the quote-self-mention use case
* consistently ignore mentions inside quoted blocks

I think the second option is best for users, but it may lead to a complicated implementation and it may hard to explain to users how things work.

@showell Steve, I would really appreciate your opinion on this one. I tried to make the solution as clean as possible (ideally, to have only one place where import failures are caught), but I think that's the best I can come up with at this point. Please let me know if anything could be improved.

### TL;DR
In all cases except running a single test suite on Python 3.4 or lower we get an error message that tells us exactly what's going on. When we run a single test suite on Python 3.4 or lower, we get a generic error message that says that there's something wrong with the imports.

The changes have been tested on Python 3.4 and Python 3.5.

### 1. Python 3.5 or higher

**1.1. Running a single test suite**

**BEFORE**
The error is raised from `run_test`, the error message:
```
ERROR: test_audit_log (unittest.loader._FailedTest)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Exception: Test doesn't have _pre_setup; something is wrong.
```
**AFTER**
The error is raised from the same place, the error message:
```
  Actual test to be run is zerver.tests.test_audit_log, but import failed.
  Importing test module directly to generate clearer traceback.
  Import test command: `/srv/zulip-py3-venv/bin/python3 -c import zerver.tests.test_audit_log`.

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<string>"", line 1, in <module>
  File ""/srv/zulip/zerver/tests/test_audit_log.py"", line 2, in <module>
    from django.utils.timezone import no as timezone_now
ImportError: cannot import name 'no'

  If that traceback is confusing, try doing the import inside `./manage.py shell`.
```

**1.2. Running several test suites at once**

**BEFORE**
The error is raised from `run_test`, the error message is the same as the ""before"" error message of a single test suite.

**AFTER**
The error is raised from `deserialize_suite`, the error message is the same as the ""after"" error message of a single test suite. It is possible to raise this error from `run_test`, but the `test_name` variable will be `unittest.loader._FailedTest.zerver` (as opposed to `unittest.loader._FailedTest.zerver.tests.test_audit_log` with a single test suite), so we won't be able tell where the error is really coming from.

### 2. Python 3.4 or lower

**2.1. Running a single test suite**

**BEFORE**
The error is raised from `run_tests`, the error message:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""/srv/zulip/zerver/lib/test_runner.py"", line 439, in run_tests
    suite = self.build_suite(test_labels, extra_tests)
  File ""/srv/zulip-py3-venv/lib/python3.4/site-packages/django/test/runner.py"", line 484, in build_suite
    tests = self.test_loader.loadTestsFromName(label)
  File ""/usr/lib/python3.4/unittest/loader.py"", line 114, in loadTestsFromName
    parent, obj = obj, getattr(obj, part)
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'test_audit_log'

  This is often caused by a test module/class/function that doesn't exist or 
  import properly. You can usually debug in a `manage.py shell` via e.g. 
    import zerver.tests.test_messages
    from zerver.tests.test_messages import StreamMessagesTest
    StreamMessagesTest.test_message_to_stream
```
**AFTER**
Everything is the same. This is the only case where the error message doesn't tell us exactly what's going on. It is possible to replace it with the error message we get on Python 3.5, but I don't think there is a ""pretty"" way to do that, so I kept it as it is for now.

**2.2. Running several test suites at once**

**BEFORE**
The error is raised from `deserialize_suite`, the error message:
```

Recently we've gotten reports that the left sidebar is laggy when you scroll through it, and it also appears that we don't properly keep the selected stream in view any more.

The best way to track this down may be to:

* create lots of streams with populate_db
* go back maybe 500 commits and see if the behavior is different (you'll need to re-provision)
* continue to either go back in time or bisect toward the present

Run this and open `combining_diacrtical_out.txt`. If you copy that into a message and then send that message, the combining diacritical marks will overflow out of the message box, obscuring other messages.

```

which looks like something tried to use an LXC configuration key that the version of LXC didn't actually support, and caused an error.

In at least the first of these, switching to Ubuntu 16.04 fixed it. That helps confirm the diagnosis, but it's not a good solution in general -- we should of course work on current OS releases.

---

A first step or two of digging:

The `lxc.pivotdir` line is the /var/lib/lxc/zulip_*/config file for my own dev environment, with this context:
```
##############################################
# vagrant-lxc base box specific configuration
# Default pivot location
lxc.pivotdir = lxc_putold

# Default mount entries
[...]
```
So, we need to produce an LXC config that works with newer LXC versions, and in particular doesn't have that line.

I suspect that we're using an older version of `vagrant-lxc`, or something else in the dependency chain, and that upgrading that will make things work. There might be some other things we need to adjust in order to use that newer version, though.

7748,Set up test suite on CircleCI,"Travis CI isn't very stable or very fast, and I think we can do better running on CircleCI.

Key differences include:
* We control the base image -- so it won't change out from under us and cause failures, and also we can preload things that save time in provision.
* Caching is more hermetic. This is actually good and bad, as Circle went a bit overboard on this; results will be totally reproducible, which is good, but it'll take a little work to maintain good performance with the venv and npm/yarn caches.
* You can run a build and SSH into the machine to look around -- super handy for debugging.
* Queue times seem much shorter.

The sequence to get us off of Travis and onto Circle will look something like (this list has been updated as we go):
- [x] Get the backend suite (with Python 3.4) running on Circle. I have this most of the way.
- [x] Set up our main GitHub repo to have Circle run on master and all PRs.
- [x] Get the frontend suite running on Circle.
- [x] Get the backend suite with Python 3.5 running on Circle. Probably use a Xenial base image.
- [x] Figure out how to parallelize all the suites effectively (see [this doc](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows/), I think) -- this is essential to making it not end up slower than Travis.
- [x] Add codecov, which I skipped initially because its setup ran into some issue.
- [x] Announce our intention to switch over the backend and frontend suites to Circle only -- fix any issues people raise, and wait a couple of days for issues to arise.
- [ ] Get the production suite running on Circle. I think there may be fancy things we can do to make this suite better than it is now in Travis, but for now just make something functionally equivalent.
- [ ] Announce and switch over for production suite the same way, turning off Travis entirely.

I did some work on this a while ago. Most of it is in master; take a look through `gitk --grep=circle` to read it, particularly the comments and commit messages.

For a few things, I made hacky changes to non-Circle-specific files; those are [in my `circle` branch](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/compare/master...gnprice:circle). The result [almost works!](https://circleci.com/gh/gnprice/zulip/146), running the backend suite.

To get started on this:
* set up CircleCI to run on your own GitHub `zulip` repo
* borrow my `circle` branch
* get the remaining backend tests working
* make non-hacky versions of all the fixes, and send a PR for them
* then we'll move on to the other suites!

- [ ] I think 1005KB looks like a mistake to people used to thinking of 1MB = 1000 KB. I think we should just use 1MB = 1000KB for the purposes of display, and allow people to go to 1.08GB.

- [ ] The trash can and download button are too far apart, and not centered under ""Actions"" (their heading).
- [ ] The date is not centered under ""Date Uploaded"" (same with Size, actually)
- [ ] We should use ""Today"", ""Yesterday"", and then just the date for Date uploaded, not the time.
- [ ] If it's easy, we should use the locale to determine weather to say ""Nov 30"" or ""30 Nov"". 

Also a bug:

* after unsubscribing from a private stream, the stream can still be found in the `All streams` list, **along with a ""Subscribe"" button. That subscribe button is clickable, but has no effect. It sends a subscription request to the server that is rejected:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7950151/33082307-c036e80e-cedc-11e7-81d3-e8c3cbe25029.png)

*  after unsubscribing from a private stream, the stream can still be found in the `All streams` list, **along with the list of users for the stream. This list is cached in the browser, it drops to ""0 users"" after reloading the page. (When the page is not reloaded, it doesn't show newly added users though, so that's wanted behavior.)


### Potentially unwanted behavior

* after unsubscribing from a private stream, the stream can still be found in the `All streams` list. It should either be removed completely, or at least display ""users hidden for this stream"" instead of ""0 users"" in the user table.

* unsubscribing from a stream and then revisiting the stream shows the stream, with a ""you unsubscribe from this stream"" ino in the bottom. being resubscribed makes that infodisappear. there is no new ""you subscribed to this stream"" info. unsubscribing again creates another ""you unsubscribed"" info.

I think the right fix for this is to just move new-login emails to be sent using a queue, like many of our other emails are.  Ideally, we'd move this into an existing queue.

invoke, but it works.

There may be a cleaner place to put the maybe-listen call than the somewhat random-looking middleware I selected. It's harmless there, though -- has a fast-path out if disabled, and another if already listening -- so I wouldn't much mind merging it as is.

That's a type error -- a programming error, not an exceptional
condition from outside the program.  Fix the programming error.

Also move the retry out of the `except:` block, so that if it also
fails we don't get the exceptions stacked on each other.  This is a
new feature of Python 3 which is sometimes indispensable for
debugging, and which surfaced this nit in the logs (on Python 2 we'd
never see the AttributeError part), but in some cases it can cause a

7408,Issue 2886,"This should fix both issue #2886 and issue #687.  The suggestion written in #687 of fixing the problem in both the display code and in the bugdown code is followed.  Instead of using `display: inline-block` as suggested, though, we set `min-height` equal to the `line-height`, `17px`.  The display attribute is not changed to inline-block as suggested in the discussion in #687 because it changes the layout in some non empty-message scenarios as well.

The bugdown regex for blockquotes now possessively matches spaces after `>`, and matches **one** or more non-newline characters afterwards, which ensures no empty blockquotes are created.  The marked.js regex for blockquotes is also changed, both for the same reason as before and to match the form and function of the regex in the python backend implementation.

7388,docs: Write or find a good guide on submitting bug reports.,"There are a lot of common errors folks new to open source make in reporting bugs, e.g.
* Saying some variant of ""it doesn't work"" without giving enough information for us to help them
* Minor things like pasting screenshots of error messages rather than the error messages themselves

etc. We have a preliminary version of a guide at http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bug-reports.html. The two links at the bottom of the guide aren't bad, and I think https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html covers the main points we'd want to convey. I think a concise version of that, maybe with a few examples of what good Zulip bug reports look like, and explanations of why they were good? 

The main thing I think a document like this should portray is giving the new contributor empathy for the receiver of the bug report. E.g. lines like 

> They know that software like the back of their hand. They know which parts they trust, and they know which parts are likely to have faults. They know intuitively what to watch for. By the time the software does something obviously wrong, they may well have already noticed something subtly wrong earlier which might give them a clue. They can observe everything the computer does during the test run, and they can pick out the important bits for themselves.
> 
> This may not be enough. They may decide they need more information, and ask you to show them the same thing again. They may ask you to talk them through the procedure, so that they can reproduce the bug for themselves as many times as they want. They might try varying the procedure a few times, to see whether the problem occurs in only one case or in a family of related cases.

from https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html. 
(It's possible the right way to clean up this document is to mainly just link to an article like this, with some context on what to look for.)

In any case, once this is done, we should link to it from two places in CONTRIBUTING.md: the ""Report an issue"" section, and the ""What makes a great Zulip contributor"" section. ",rishig,b'area: documentation (developer) help wanted',2017-11-14T23:51:51Z,2018-11-28T00:04:09Z

allowing for spaces around both $$ when crafting inline TeX instead of
forcing everything to be crammed together, e.g. $$x=7$$.  In order to
avoid uninentionally creating inline expressions, the opening and
closing $$'s of an inline expression must now both exactly consist of
two dollar signs, no more and no less.

We have code to handle this in some common cases in `zerver.lib.html_diff.py`, but it doesn't work well for cases where markup adds/removes HTML tags.  For example, here's what happens with the `lxml` library: 

```
In [17]: htmldiff('<p>text</p><img src=""anything"">', '<p>delete</p>')
Out[17]: '<p><ins>delete</ins></p> <p><del>text</del></p><del><img src=""anything""></del>'
```

vs. our existing code (with a few print statements to show what's going on):

```
In [18]: highlight_html_differences('<p>text</p><img src=""anything"">', '<p>delete</p>')
[(0, '<p>'), (-1, 'text</p><img src=""anything""'), (1, 'delete</p'), (0, '>')]  # ops
2017-10-29 20:23:46.973 ERR  [] HTML diff produced mal-formed HTML for message None
<p><span class=""highlight_text_deleted"">text</span></p><img src=""anything""<span class=""highlight_text_inserted"">delete</span></p<>
Out[18]: '<p>delete</p>'
```

(The error line is how we we avoid the UI totally breaking).

We should be able to remove almost all of the code in that file when we replace it with the `lxml` version.

(We may need to use `lxml` to rewrite the `ins/del` tags to fit the span tags our frontend expects afterwards)

@HarshitOnGitHub this is probably a good project for you, given your recent work on lxml stuff.",timabbott,b'area: message-editing bug priority: high',2017-10-29T20:27:19Z,2017-10-30T21:15:09Z
7217,copy-paste: Copy the recipient bar if and only if selecting from more than one recipient block.,"![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/890911/32147560-c7066616-bca6-11e7-816d-e59265c63f97.png)

Copying the messages with bar and baz (select with mouse, and use Ctrl-c) gives
```
Rishi Gupta: bar

test here > recipient block 2 Today

Rishi Gupta: baz
```

The desired behavior would be to also have `test here > recipient block 1 Today` up top.
Note that if you copy all three messages, it works as desired. 

In the other direction: if you select messages foo and bar, it does copy the recipient bar header, which it should not. 

Basically, the current algorithm seems to be: the recipient bar header is copied if: you select more than 1 message, and select the first message in the recipient block.

The correct algorithm is: the recipient bar header is copied if: you select messages from more than 1 recipient block, and select any message in the recipient block.

(it's cutoff, because `internal_send_message` doesn't reraise).

I think the right fix for this is to make `do_create_user`, when passed `active=False`, create the user normally and then call `do_deactivate_user` on it.  It shouldn't be too hard to do, and would make this sort of testing more faithful (in that the users would be guaranteed to be setup normally).

7179,Mysterious `Could not find UserMessage with message_id <messageid>` bug,"Today I saw a strange set of symptoms on chat.zulip.org:

* We got exception emails of the form `Could not find UserMessage with message_id <messageid>`.  The code path in question is when the push notifications queue processor tries to look up the UserMessage row for the message.  In theory, this should be impossible, because we created UserMessage rows in an atomic operation earlier in `do_send_messages`.
* I confirmed that as of 10 minutes later, the UserMessage row does in fact exist.  So it's not failing to be created.
* I confirmed the user in question was 5 days old and not `long_term_idle`.  

So I'm forced to believe that the problem here is probably an issue where our use of `transaction.atomic` in `do_send_messages` is insufficient for ensuring that change actually makes it to the database in a way visible to other clients before we do the `queue_json_publish` that eventually leads to the push notification code running.

We fix this bug by changing the function that handles the ESC key
during an edit to pass the correct object to the
message_edit.end function.

7059,push notifications go to muted topics on streams with stream_push_notify set,"I think to fix this, we'll want to change `get_recipient_info` to accept the `topic` as an argument and do a `MutedTopic.objects.filter(stream=stream, topic=topic)` query to see if anyone has it muted, and if so, filter them from the `stream_push_notify` list.

While we're at this, we should probably add `db_index=True` for some columns in `MutedTopic`  to make this query fast.

This is a follow-up to https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/issues/1314.  I added a failing test for this logic as the second-to-last case in `test_end_to_end_missedmessage_hook`, so we should be able to just change a `True` to a `False` there when we fix this.

@showell this is probably a good project for you to take care of, since the only tricky thing is doing the MutedTopic table query correctly in `get_recipient_info`, and you have good context on that table.",timabbott,b'area: notifications (messages) bug priority: high',2017-10-18T05:48:56Z,2017-10-24T00:28:05Z

7032,Improve debuggability of syntax errors in `/etc/zulip/settings.py` files,"As discussed in #6993, it's common for a broken `settings.py` file to mean that Django doesn't start, and thus `/var/log/zulip/errors.log` remains empty; instead, a user needs to know to look in `/var/log/zulip/django.log` to see why Django didn't start.  I think with some clever coding in `zproject/wsgi.py`, we might be able to ensure that something gets logged into `errors.log` in the event that Django can't start up due to a `settings.py` import failure.  

This would be valuable to fix since users who don't see anything in an error log when the server 500s can quickly become discouraged about Zulip's quality.  If fixing this in the clever way I suggested turns out to be difficult, we should instead (or in addition, perhaps) invest in documenting `django.log` as a place to look if `errors.log` is empty.",timabbott,b'area: production installer priority: high',2017-10-17T06:51:09Z,2019-06-24T19:21:49Z

6993,"""Attempting to send a GCM push notification, but no API key was configured""","This is a brand new install on an Ubuntu 16.04 box.  The install was done using the standard script and following the instructions in http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prod-install.html?highlight=install.

I followed the steps at http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prod-mobile-push-notifications.html under ""How to sign up"".  I emailed support and sent the requisite information.  I received a reply from @rishig saying I was good to go.  I uncommented the ""PUSH_NOTIFICATION_BOUNCER_URL"" line in /etc/zulip/settings.py.  I then restarted the server and reloaded the front page of my Zulip instance in my browser.  Instead of the standard UI, I just get a single line of text saying ""Internal server error"".  When I comment out that ""PUSH_NOTIFICATION_BOUNCER_URL"" line and restart the server, things go back to normal.

/var/log/zulip/error.log has one line that seems relevant:

    2017-10-13 23:45:23,643 WARNING  Attempting to send a GCM push notification, but no API key was configured

The docs on push notification don't mention an API key, so either there's a documentation bug (a missing step?) or something weirder is happening here.

6984,Broken search results for query `handle 'zulip_admin'`,"### Reproduction

1. Search for `handle 'zulip_admins'`.
2. The search results should look similarly broken to this:

*Note: `handle 'zulip_admin'` is the shortest string I found that breaks the results. Queries like `handl 'zulip_admin'` work fine for me. Also, the results break for me only **after August 16th**: Everything before that (starting with a message from August 9th) is displayed fine.",roberthoenig,b'area: search bug',2017-10-13T14:37:51Z,2017-11-07T21:13:54Z

However, we also recently had the error email format get super verbose, it's possible the right fix is to correct the tracebacks, and that will magically fix the ZulipLimiter problem.

I got to this narrow by clicking on it, and all the messages are from last night (though my browser was open overnight), and I didn't send any of them, so this isn't a local echo bug.  It's also not a message editing bug, because none of the involved messages were edited.

So, I think the bug must be that these were actually inserted into the message list in the wrong order.

6934,errors: Force a super-simpler handler for 400 errors.,"This works around a bug in Django in handling the error case of a
client sending an inappropriate HTTP `Host:` header.  Various
internal Django machinery expects to be able to casually call
`request.get_host()`, which will attempt to parse that header, so an
exception will be raised.  The exception-handling machinery attempts
to catch that exception and just turn it into a 400 response... but
in a certain case, that machinery itself ends up trying to call
`request.get_host()`, and we end up with an uncaught exception that
causes a 500 response, a chain of tracebacks in the logs, and an email
to the server admins.  See example below.

That `request.get_host` call comes in the midst of some CSRF-related
middleware, which doesn't even serve any function unless you have a
form in your 400 response page that you want CSRF protection for.
We use the default 400 response page, which is a 26-byte static
HTML error message.  So, just send that with no further ado.

Example exception from server logs (lightly edited):

6901,Optimize performance of test_public_urls,"Using `./tools/test-backend --processes=1 --report-slow-tests`, I found that `test_public_urls` is by far our slowest test, taking about 4.3s on my laptop (out of 85s total), or 5%.  The cause is, of course, that it renders every single /help/ document, which is fairly expensive.  

I was about to decrease runtime from 4.3s to 2s by just deleting `sidebar.md`, so a big part of the cost here is handling the large number of links in the included sidebar.  It might be worthwhile to, for the purposes of this test, do this testing with all but a handful of the /help/ docs with a mocked `sidebar.md` that's empty.

Smarter would be to make `render_markdown_path` cache the rendering of `sidebar.md`, at least in the test suite and production (might not want it in development).  But we should be careful; we removed the previous caching implementation here: 51233590a2561a58d358556ba497a4cc36d16b48.

It may also be worth doing some profiling; I'd totally believe we have some sort of bug here.

In terms of what language to use, for private messages, we should use the language of the recipient user.  For stream messages, we should use the default language for the organization.  We may need to call the Django methods to change the language in these internal_send_message type code paths for this to work at runtime.  But I think it's be reasonable to start with just tagging the strings so translators can start working on them.

A related set of strings we'll want to translate is those in `zerver/lib/onboarding.py`, but I think we might want to defer that until @rishig does another pass on the text, since they're fairly long?

6671,logging: Stop forcing pre-Python 2.5 legacy config behavior.,"The `disable_existing_loggers` option to the `logging.config` module
turns on a rather complicated behavior of disabling some, but not all,
loggers that might have been already configured when the call to
`logging.config.dictConfig` or `logging.config.fileConfig` is made:

> This behaviour is to disable any existing loggers unless they or
> their ancestors are explicitly named in the logging configuration.
  (https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.config)

Turns out the only reason this is there is as a compatibility hack to
match the behavior of Python 2.4 and below.  See the thread where the
new behavior was introduced: https://bugs.python.org/issue3136

Just as the author of the new behavior explains in that thread from
2008, the legacy behavior forces all logging configuration to be
awkwardly centralized in one place.  That makes the code harder to
read, and it perennially causes confusion when a perfectly
normal-looking `logging.getLogger` call at the top level of one module
mysteriously has no effect, while that in another module works fine,
under the influence of the details of what gets imported when.

So, switch to the shiny new behavior of Python 2.5.

This may cause a few of the logfiles in ZULIP_PATHS to become active

What we should do is use an actual error code so we can reliably check for this specific error (which is sent by the push bouncer server).  Then, the client aka individual Zulip server should raise an exception that's much more clear that the problem is their credentials are not registered for the push bouncer service.

6630,Electron Windows client causes task bar to activate when posts are made to non-notifying streams,"I'm seeing this behavior on Windows 10 when using ZulipDesktop 1.4.0.

Process:
- In the Widnows task bar settings , enable ""Automatically hide the task bar in desktop mode""
- In Zulip, pick a high volume stream and in the settings, turn off ""Receive Desktop Notifications"" and ""Receive Audio Notifications""
- Wait until someone posts in the stream
- The task bar will become visible, overlaying part of whatever is currently on the desktop and not disappearing until you click on the task bar

Why this is an issue:
- When dealing with high-volume, low-priority threads, you don't want them interrupting while you're working
- Having the task bar float out continuously is highly disruptive
- The natural way to say ""Don't bug me about new posts in this stream"" is to disable notifications

Here `missed_message` is the parameter of `handle_push_notification` that is just the data that was in the queue -- so that data is missing the `triggers` field. This `triggers` field was added recently, in the code eventually merged on #6535.

Reading the code, it looks like there are two places we put things into the `missedmessage_mobile_notifications` queue which this comes from:
* `process_message_event`, which is called when a message is first sent, and which got this logic;
* `missedmessage_hook`, which is called when a user's event queue is GC'd, and which didn't get this logic.

So the latter should populate `triggers` too. Possibly that logic should get factored out to avoid duplication.

I don't think the email mirror has a clear maintainer, so probably someone will just need to dig into the code to investigate this.  It's fairly likely that the correct fix probably involves discarding the NULL characters from the email.

For someone working on this, I'd first write a (failing) test that includes an email with a NULL character in it (might need to do some more general email mirror testing work (improving coverage, etc.) if `test_email_mirror.py` doesn't have something similar), and then we can do the fix.  The hard part will be getting the test to trigger.  ",timabbott,b'area: notifications (other) bug help wanted',2017-09-14T15:14:34Z,2017-10-12T17:49:48Z

I think we want catch these two classes of exceptions in the queue worker email code paths, and just re-enqueue the event to be handled later once things are working again (maybe with some limited retry count like 3 per item), and only throw an exception if it fails every time.  That should make things reliable.

The main one is going to be the `missed_message` worker, but ideally we'd be able to just have a decorator function that we can wrap all the email sending worker `consume` functions with that just takes care of this: Checking the retry account, calling the wrapped function inside a `try/except`, and if it throws specific exceptions that are usually network problems, retry.

@umairwaheed would you be up for taking a pass at this one?

6516,Buggy upgrade process from 1.4.x to 1.6.x and above,"Migration 0032_verify_all_medium_avatar_images.py uses code from `zerver.lib.upload`, which was changed between 1.5 and 1.6 to make different assumptions about the paths avatars are in (there's a later migration that takes care of this, 0060_move_avatars_to_be_uid_based.py; the change was to add the realm_id as a directory in the paths, and also to hash on user ID, not email).  

What we need to do to fix this is replace the `zerver.lib.upload` import with a copy or monkey-patched version or something of the code of that code from Zulip 1.4.3, so that one can safely upgrade a server with at least one avatar uploaded from 1.4.3 to master.  Should be easy to test in a development environment.  The exception is this:

6507,Evaluate switching to RapidJSON (from ujson),"In speed-critical codepaths like message send, we use `ujson` (""UltraJSON"") as our JSON implementation, because it's faster than the `json` in the stdlib, or `simplejson` which is the PyPI version (so can be more up to date) of the same library.

Speed is cool, but unfortunately on the other hand it's kind of buggy; see e.g. #6332. And unfortunately that's not an isolated issue; quoting myself from that issue:

> The ujson tracker has [had this issue open](https://github.com/esnme/ultrajson/issues/156) [i.e., the root cause of #6332] since 2014.
> 
> The number of segfaults, crashes, and memory corruption issues in the [ujson open issues](https://github.com/esnme/ultrajson/issues) suggest this may not be a super reliable or vigorously-maintained library. The benchmarks in its README are impressive, but if we can we may be better off using the stdlib's `json` (aka `simplejson`).

The answer to that last hope, on further study, was that in critical places we can't; the speed difference is too great, and the speed does matter to some paths.

Fortunately, there is another alternative! @derAnfaenger discovered [`rapidjson`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-rapidjson). A [benchmark](http://artem.krylysov.com/blog/2015/09/29/benchmark-python-json-libraries/) suggests it's competitive with UltraJSON for speed. This one is a wrapper around an underlying C++ implementation [RapidJSON](https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson). Both the RapidJSON and `python-rapidjson` issue trackers are much more encouraging -- issues get prompt and helpful replies, and when they're real bugs get fixed.

So, we should try it out, and if it's as hoped then switch. This would look something like
* prepare a branch that switches our requirements and imports to `rapidjson`
* fix any tests that break
* time message send and perhaps other critical paths, and compare to master
* if it works and isn't materially slower, merge!

6461,compose: Fix rendering error with message edit forms.,"When a new message was posted, the UI would decide to re-render the message which was being edited. This would only happen if you were editing the last sent message in the narrow.

After re-rendering the message into a new element, it sees that the message was previously being edited and so hides the `message_content` and calls the `show_edit_message` function which adds the edit form to the element and calls `.show()` on the form. The `.message_edit` element has the default `display: none` property in the stylesheets but the custom jQuery element has the `display` property blank (I think this is because of it not being in the DOM so it doesn't show the inherited properties). Because of this, the show function doesn't make any chance to the display property and the message gets rendered with both the message_content and edit form hidden.

To fix this, we explicitly set the display to block instead of using show.

It's not in any `translations.json`, and consequently doesn't make it to Transifex and doesn't get translated.

Looking at the source, the `i18n.t` call continues to the next line, so I suspect that's not a coincidence:
```
$ rg -A1 'You subscribed' static/js/ static/locale/ja/

There are a few other messages like that (`git grep 'i18n.t[^)]*$' static/js/`). Some work, like this one (actually this is also busted, in that we end up translating just the first part, but that's a different symptom):

6351,admin/org settings: Cannot scroll through Notifications stream dropdown menu to select options.,"Clicking on the **Notifications stream** option on the **Organizations settings** page produces a dropdown menu allowing organization administrators to change the default notifications stream for the organization.

![screenshot at aug 30 10-03-27](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15116870/29885133-7f592b2a-8d6a-11e7-8653-79ba415e06d8.png)

However, if there are more than 8 streams that an admin can select, the other options are cut off from the dropdown menu, and the admin needs to rely on the Filter streams input to find the appropriate stream that was cut off. This behavior potentially misleads admins into thinking that the streams that aren't included at the top of the menu aren't possible candidates for notifcations stream.

To resolve this issue, I propose that the dropdown menu either be implemented as a `<select>` like input or use a scrollbar to scroll through all options.

(This was discovered while I was documenting the **Notifications stream** option, and the behavior left me highly confused, and I suspect that new admins would also encounter the same issue as well)",synicalsyntax,b'area: settings (admin/org) area: settings UI bug feedback wanted priority: blocker',2017-08-30T17:05:09Z,2017-09-28T01:47:12Z

6332,ujson causes UnicodeEncodeError in email mirror,"We've gotten a few exceptions like this recently on zulipchat.com:

    self.publish(queue_name, ujson.dumps(body))
UnicodeEncodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't encode character '\udcef' in position 6226: surrogates not allowed
```

The request data in this example looks like
```
- POST: {'secret': ['**********'], 'data': ['{""msg_text"": ""Received: from [...]\\udcef\\udcbf\\udcbd[...]"", ""recipient"": ""***""}']}
```

The core of the issue appears to be that `ujson` will decode a JSON document that looks like this, but will then fail if you ask it to encode the result:
```
In [39]: ujson.loads('""\\udcef\\udcbf\\udcbd""')
Out[39]: '\udcef\udcbf\udcbd'

In [40]: ujson.dumps(ujson.loads('""\\udcef\\udcbf\\udcbd""'))

----> 1 ujson.dumps(ujson.loads('""\\udcef\\udcbf\\udcbd""'))

UnicodeEncodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't encode character '\udcef' in position 0: surrogates not allowed
```
(The result of `loads` there is a string of three characters, each of which is not a real character but rather a surrogate value. The surrogates were originally carved out for use in UTF-16, to encode Unicode in 16-bit elements, but in Python they're now used for losslessly encoding mostly-UTF-8 bytestrings, like Unix filenames, in Python text strings. This particular sequence of three surrogates doesn't seem to fit either of those uses, so it's a mystery where it came from. If you take the low 8 bits from each of these surrogates as a sequence of bytes, you do get the UTF-8 encoding of [U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER](http://unicode.org/cldr/utility/character.jsp?a=FFFD) -- so there are probably multiple layers of wrongness involved here.)

Compare `json` from the stdlib, which handles the round-trip with no trouble:
```
In [41]: json.dumps(ujson.loads('""\\udcef\\udcbf\\udcbd""'))
Out[41]: '""\\udcef\\udcbf\\udcbd""'
```

The ujson tracker has [had this issue open](https://github.com/esnme/ultrajson/issues/156) since 2014.

The number of segfaults, crashes, and memory corruption issues in the [ujson open issues](https://github.com/esnme/ultrajson/issues) suggest this may not be a super reliable or vigorously-maintained library. The benchmarks in its README are impressive, but if we can we may be better off using the stdlib's `json` (aka `simplejson`).

6321,Stream reset talking to APNs,"With the new APNs provider implementation that landed a couple of days ago, we're sometimes (~20% of the time) seeing this exception on zulipchat.com:

    raise StreamResetError(""Stream forcefully closed"")
hyper.http20.exceptions.StreamResetError: Stream forcefully closed
```

I'm not 100% sure what this means, but it sounds like the APNs server is closing the connection. With this frequency, that probably means something we're doing wrong, either in our application code or in the `apns2` or `hyper` libraries underneath.

Our application code for this is super simple:
```
        stream_id = client.send_notification_async(
            device.token, payload, topic='org.zulip.Zulip',
            expiration=expiration)
        result = client.get_notification_result(stream_id)
```
so I think the issue is likely to be in one of the libraries.

On some study of these two libraries, I'm not excited about trying to debug the issue right now. The `hyper` library (which implements HTTP/2) is explicitly not mature -- the docs say it's ""very early alpha"", and more recently the author says it's past that but still [""I'm not sure that people will get much joy out of using it in production""](https://github.com/Lukasa/hyper/issues/288). I think I'll add a retry loop and call it a day -- that's apparently [worked for someone else](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41211416/im-not-able-to-find-any-information-on-this-error-im-seeing-streamreseterror) with the same problem.

It would be neat to fix the bug, as either a service to the Python community (if it is in one of the libraries) or a little voyage of discovery (if not -- and even then, it can probably become a doc patch to one or both libraries, again a service to the Python community.)

Alternatively, the most robust and full-featured HTTP implementation for Python has long been `pycurl`, which is a thin layer over `libcurl` -- and [curl supports HTTP/2](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/http2.html). So for a really solid implementation of talking to APNs we may just end up using that. It'll be more code to write -- the major downside of pycurl is that it's a lower-level interface than alternatives -- so not right now.

6298,Optimize performance of sending messages with thousands of soft-deactivated users,"On chat.zulip.org right now, we have about 2300 users subscribed to some of our larger streams (which has a fairly lower-power Digital Ocean machine with 8GB of RAM for everything, including database, memcached, and application servers).

When sending a message to one of these streams, the backend can take 500ms to process sending a message (compared with 50-100ms for a private message with 1 recipient). On a more powerful server, these numbers might be half that, which is still significant.  More importantly, these numbers grow linearly, so with 20K inactive users on a stream, things would start to get quite large.

Because of local echo, these numbers are not a huge problem (in that in most communities, it's rare to be sending rapid-fire to thousands of people), but I think it should be possible with some careful profiling to make this considerably faster.  Huge progress was already made in #5194 with our soft-deactivation system; review that if you're curious.

Profiling would be helpful, but I believe the next major thing that we need to do in order to optimize performance here is to stop fetching UserProject objects from the database for the soft-deactivated subscribers to a stream (or ).  

There's 2 natural problems to work on here:

1. `do_send_messages` calls `get_recipient_user_profiles`, which fetches a UserProfile object for every subscriber to the stream in the `message['active_recipients'] object (an expensive operation if there are thousands of them!).  In theory, we could just fetch those subscribers who are either not long-term idle or mentioned.  In `do_send_messages`, that `active_recipients` object  is only used for a few things before the point where we check `long_term_idle` in the code today (and thus could presumably start filtering).  The main place it is used is being passed to `render_markdown`, which turn just uses the user IDs to check for whether the message contains any `alert_words`.  So I think we could experiment with the following flow:

* First, just fetch all the `alert_words` for users who are subscribed to the stream.  This should be a really fast database query since everything has indexes, and will have a small data set in the reply, since most users don't have any `alert_words` at all.  That should be enough to get `render_markdown_path` to finish.  

* Then, we fetch from the database just those subscribers who are either (A) not long-term idle or (B) appear in `mentioned_user_ids` or `user_ids_with_alert_words` and populate the new `message['active_recipients']` from that.  

This will probably involve some somewhat messy refactoring, and does carry an extra round-trip to the database, but I think would have an overall pretty positive effect on performance of sending to a stream, since we'd only ever interact with the UserProfile objects for those subscribers that we'll later write a row to the database for anyway (and just have to deal with the `alert_words` for the rest).

2. We also fetch (from a memcached cache) every active user in the realm at the start of every markdown operation.  The problem here is that zerver/lib/bugdown/__init__py, our markdown processor, expects to be passed a data set containing all the active users in the realm.  The reason bugdown expects that is the way we timeouts in Bugdown means that doing database queries from within bugdown (e.g. to look up a user that was mentioned) can end up leaking database connections (if I recall correctly?  It was a long time ago I last looked at this) and thus doesn't work.

I think probably the next step before we implement either of these is to do some speedy profiling to just see how much perf impact these two changes could have.  E.g. for problem 1, if we just modify `get_recipient_user_profiles` to only fetch the non-soft-deactivated users (breaking alert words for the rest), how much time does that save?

And for problem 2, if we just break mentions by using an empty dict, how much time does that save (both with say, 2000 soft-deactivated users)?

Once we have that data, we can prioritize the work on solving those two problems correctly (in the way I describe).

Part 2 of making this work well is to add code to send a PM to the bot's owner when one of these 500s occurs letting them know about the issue, to make debugging easier, but let's leave that for its own follow-up issue since there are a few complicated design questions to decide.

6189,Annoying whitespace next to bot key.,"### Issue

Sometimes, it is necessary or convenient to copy a bot's api key manually, that is, by selecting it and copying it.
There is a whitespace character between the API key and the regenerate button, as seen in this screenshot.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7950151/29480018-c44eedda-8475-11e7-93aa-2bf65b248f76.png)

This whitespace character can cause selections to inadvertently include a trailing whitespace, which can be very hard to debug.

### Solution

There is currently no nice fix for this. According to [this SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5078239/how-to-remove-the-space-between-inline-block-elements), proper CSS solutions  removing the WS are still experimental, various ""hacks"" unreliable.

One robust method is addressing the root of the issue - some whitespace character between the respective inline methods. This whitespace can be either completely removed, or ""commented out"". In this case, the affected code would then look like
```
<span class=""value"">aQVQmSd6j6IHphJ9m1jhgHdbnhl5ZcsY</span><!--
--><button type=""submit"" class=""button no-style btn-secondary regenerate_bot_api_key"" title=""Neuen API-Schlüssel generieren"" data-email=""myhubot-bot@chat.zulip.org"" style=""margin-left: 5px;"">
```
Then, some margin can be added to the `button` in order to recreate the inline space. Is this solution acceptable?",roberthoenig,b'area: settings UI feedback wanted',2017-08-18T22:39:56Z,2017-08-23T22:32:13Z
6184,Zulip server crashing daily,"## Summary of issue

- Users are unable to use Zulip
- Restarting rabbitmq fixes the problem
- Problem seems to occur daily now (or every two days)
- Users have to login again (and receive a new login email)
- All users appear offline
- ***New information not present in the chat:*** Seems like our CPU is spiking to 100% when this issue occurs

#### Other info

- Version: 1.6.0
- Hosted on DigitalOcean: 2gb ram + 40gb disk
- First deployed 2017-07-13

*The following is copy pasted from chat.zulip.org https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/issues/topic/Zulip.20server.20crashing*

Hey we've been running our Zulip server a a 2gb DO box without problems for about three weeks. We only have about 5 active users and lately we've been experiencing a ""Woops something went wrong, please drop us a line.""

I follow some of the steps on

http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prod-troubleshooting.html

And restarting rabbitMQ via fixes the problem

`service rabbitmq-server restart`

However I'm finding that it's happening more frequently -- three days in a row now.

Can anyone possible point me towards some logs I can potentially look at or maybe something I can do to debug this problem next time it happens?

Two fixes ought to be merged: switching to the message-at-a-time API (it's easier to get working, and the efficiency difference is immaterial right now), and dealing with the bytes/str distinction in what we get from the Redis client. The latter commit needs a bit more polish, and the other doesn't trivially rebase to the front of the branch, so they aren't immediately mergeable.

Posting this branch mainly for reference as we continue debugging.

6109,Scrollback in stream stops prematurely,"In multiple streams on chat.zulip.org, I observe the following behavior:
* Narrow to an old topic, scroll to the top.
* Switch to stream narrow, and scroll to the top.
* The top is nowhere near the actual beginning of the stream, but no further message loading happens, and the gray Zulip-logo ""this is the beginning"" marker sits inert and doesn't do its spinner animation.

First example: I was playing with the new, expanded ""more topics"", so I hit that widget on #**design** on chat.zulip.org . Went to the topic at the bottom of the list, scrolled to the top of that topic ([here](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/design/subject/Night.20Mode/near/181210)), then hit `s` to zoom out to the stream. The top of that was only a little higher ([here](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/design/near/1778180)), and sure didn't look like the start of the stream. But hitting page-up to scroll didn't do anything, and the little dark-gray Zulip logo marking the start wasn't spinning like anything was still loading -- it just sat there. Switching back to `S`, I could scroll up further. With maybe 5 more quick repetitions of `s`, scroll to top, `S`, scroll to top, repeat, I got to the [actual start](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/design/subject/new.20stream/near/150417) of the stream.

Then I tried the same thing on #**issues**. Same thing happened -- alternating `S` with `s` and scrolling up made incremental progress, where the scrollback on `s` repeatedly ended more recently than the actual beginning of the stream.

6051,Text renders with odd spacing (in Chrome on Linux),"I'm not sure if this is new; or I used to be masking it with the zoom settings I used to have tweaked; or if it's always been this way and I just can't unsee it now that I spent a few hours over the past few days getting my desktop setup working great at high pixel density and choosing better fonts to work with that.

In any case, I'm now in a relatively vanilla configuration -- no scaling happening through X or my window manager, and browser at 100% zoom for chat.zulip.org. And the text in the Zulip app looks pretty bad to me:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28173/29047406-78287424-7b80-11e7-9e5f-a7707ae8c383.png)
In particular I think the spacing is quite odd, as if it's missing the spacing hints it needs to render properly.

Chrome dev tools say the actual rendered font is ""Source Sans Pro"", and it's coming from Zulip's /static/third/ tree. That's from the `'Humbug'` entry at the front of the `font-family` list, and our `static/styles/fonts.css` has a `@font-face` directive to point that family at a bunch of files in `static/third/sourcesans/`.

If I delete the `'Humbug'` entry, the text looks like this instead, which I think is much better:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28173/29047675-a6d790a6-7b81-11e7-9daf-831ad69b5d01.png)
That's Arimo, which is my default sans-serif font.

Does the text look like my first screenshot to other people too, or does it look much better? If better, maybe there's something we can fix to make the spacing work. Otherwise, maybe we can pick a different font; there are several good free/libre ones that are new since we picked Source Sans Pro in 2013, including Arimo (the Chrome OS default sans-serif font; has serif & mono cousins) as well as [Noto](https://www.google.com/get/noto/).

5981,Figure out how to handle caching in `var/` around Vagrant rebuilds,"We now have a bunch of super useful caching tooling as part of `provision`.  Most of it generates things under places like `/srv/zulip-venv-cache`, which is nice, in that if you use the same Zulip checkout for multiple Vagrant guests (or for Vagrant + the root machine), everything works fine, since those paths aren't shared.

However, we've recently added a few stamp files that live under `var/`:
* provision_version
* postgres_init_test_db_hash
* populate_db_hash
* migration_status_test
* migration_status_dev
* available-migrations
* apt_dependenices_hash

Unfortunately, none of these files gets cleared if you destroy and recreate your Vagrant guest.  

A few notes:
* I don't see a way in Vagrant to run code whenever we destroy a guest.
* We want `var/` to be shared with the host for convenient access to log files, etc.  This probably excludes solutions like making `var/` a symlink in a Vagrant guest.

1) Having a model in Vagrant where the bundle of stamp files gets moved to live somewhere under `srv/` alongside the caches.
2) Adding a file under `/srv/` containing a string like `ZULIP_DEV_UUID=UUID`, and then basically have all these files live in paths of the form `var/%(zulip_dev_uuid)/populate_db_hash`.  

I think approach (2) feels pretty reasonable; we'll want to add a common function somewhere in `tools/lib/` that our various tools can interact with to get the correct `zulip_dev_uuid` subdirectory.

5980,"prod: Make `cp` copy a directory to its target, not into it.","This was causing `language_options.json` never to get updated by
`upgrade-zulip-from-git` after first deploy, generally causing an
install to claim less translation coverage than it actually had.

The same bug exists in several other spots in this file.  Some of
our repetitive-yet-subtly-different uses of `cp` should probably
turn into just a list of arguments to one `rsync -R` command,
or a handful of them where they need to interleave with other steps.

Let this serve as a placeholder for me to make a comfortable
dev/test environment for myself for this kind of prod-ops script
and then go fix those in general.

ALSO: this should probably really use `rsync --delete`.  For example,
in prod on zulipchat.com we still have lying around a `locale/zh_CN`
directory, even though in a freshly-built static tree there's only
`locale/zh_Hans` instead.

the regex used for matching realm filters. On the backend we are using
regex with negative lookbehind to perform matches but since javascript
regex don't support lookbehind we are using a workaround on the frontend
using `contains_backend_only_syntax()` function which detects if a realm
filter can be rendered correctly by backend only and if so it stops the
message from getting echoed locally.

There appear to be source maps for the webpack bundles in `/home/zulip/prod-static/webpack-bundles/`:
```

But our code is looking in `~/deployments/current/prod-static/source-map`, which just has the source map files generated not using webpack:

- [x] Speed up scrolling on transition between integration sub-pages:
> ... if you're scrolled a ways down and then click on an individual integration, there's a fairly slow scroll that happens to take you to the top of the page as the new integration loads.
- [x] In the mobile single-integration view, it'd be nice to have some sort of heading at the top showing at least the name of the integration, and maybe the logo too.
- [x] ~Limit the width for the /integrations/#github individual integration type pages. (not clear on the intention of this -- which width was being referred to here?)~
- [x] For things like Bitbucket/GitHub/Jira/Trello where there's a current version and a legacy version, have a way to tag the ""legacy"" one to not be displayed in the index, and the only way to get to it is by clicking a link from the non-legacy one.

This is mostly useful in cases where the original sender of the message forgets to add a topic to the message and later edits the topic.

This PR is an effort to make our emoji picker more organized and user-friendly by introducing categorization. A part of this PR was done at PyCon after which I took it up for polishing it.

* Reworked the navigation system.
* Improved the search.
* Made code easier to read/follow and deleted some dead code.

5598,"Error responses should have machine-readable codes, not only messages","In at least a couple of places in the web frontend, we inspect the message text in an error returned by the server. This is a bug, because error message text gets translated -- many error messages may be shown to the user -- so if the user is using Zulip in a language other than English, the condition will fail.

Two known examples:
```
$ rg -C2 responseText.*indexOf
static/js/server_events.js
189-                // garbage collected, immediately reload.
190-                if ((xhr.status === 400) &&
191:                    (JSON.parse(xhr.responseText).msg.indexOf(""Bad event queue id"") !== -1)) {
192-                    page_params.event_queue_expired = true;
193-                    reload.initiate({immediate: true,

static/js/channel.js
31-        if (xhr.status === 403) {
32-            try {
33:                if (JSON.parse(xhr.responseText).msg.indexOf(""CSRF Error:"") !== -1) {
34-                    reload.initiate({immediate: true,
35-                                     save_pointer: true,
```

The impact of the first example (""Bad event queue id"") is that when using Zulip in a language for which we have a translation for the string ""Bad event queue ide: %s"" (e.g., German), if you come back to a tab after being idle for a while, your client persists indefinitely in a half-broken state: you can browse, and even send messages, but you don't get new messages and you have the red ""Unable to connect to Zulip"" (except translated) message at the top of the window.

There's nothing correct the frontend can do here; it needs better information from the server. And the server is right to translate the message text. What we should do is also send a numeric error code.

I think the way I would do this first is
* add an optional field with a name like `error_code` to `JsonableError`;
* start an enum somewhere for values of the error code -- for now this can be duplicated between some code in the backend and the frontend;
* add just a couple of values to that enum, the two we know we need;
* use the new field for these two errors.

An ideal solution should have the list of code values and identifier names for them in one place, to be consumed by the backend, the web frontend, and other clients like the mobile and desktop apps. (Probably also the user-facing text for each error, like ""Bad event queue id"".) We should sort that out before rolling this out on a wide scale with tons of different error codes. But given that we have at least one live bug here (probably two), we shouldn't block on that solution before fixing these bugs.

5545,i18next caching seems too eager,"I'm not sure of the scope of this in production -- hopefully it's not an issue there, but I haven't investigated. It was very confusing in dev and cost me probably half an hour of puzzlement today.

In development, if you edit `static/locale/LANG/translations.json` for your chosen `LANG`, it doesn't take effect. Reloading the tab doesn't do it; even shift-reloading, to force the browser to reload all resources, doesn't do it.

Looking in `static/js/translations.js`, which is where we invoke i18next and configure it, I find that if I disable caching there:
```
 var cacheOptions = {
-    enabled: true,
+    enabled: false,
     prefix: 'i18next:' + page_params.server_generation + ':',
     expirationTime: 2*7*24*60*60*1000,  // 2 weeks
 };
```
that resolves the issue. So apparently i18next is caching the `translations.json` -- a very reasonable and useful thing to do -- and here it is caching it much too hard, holding onto it even when the file has actually changed.

One possible clue is that `curl -I` on various static files in dev always returns the same value for the `Etag` header -- the SHA-1 hash of the empty string, it turns out -- but the `Last-Modified` header is correct. Perhaps i18next is relying on `Etag`, and maybe that's a thing you shouldn't do in 2017 (I have no idea.)

Or maybe its cache just totally ignores any metadata it could get from the server and it unconditionally caches for the given `expirationTime`. In that case, that'd be a problem in prod -- it'd be unfortunate for everyone using a non-English language we have good translations for to see every new string we add or edit in English for the first 2 weeks or so after their server gets the new code.

5502,[WIP] Bots (testing): Cleaner check_expected_responses implementation,"I'm aware that @derAnfaenger indicated that the test framework was now 'stable', but I've been working on this a little recently after mentioning to @showell how the approach of all the extra keyword arguments just felt a little wrong, so thought I'd better get it out there.

While some of the changes to that interface are my doing, I was trying to write tests for pollbot and realised the interface was not exactly obvious; in trying to improve that, I've arrived at a solution which:
* I believe is as simple as the previous case for straight-forward cases (good defaults)
* Works so as to extend further the input/output in an 'expected' specification
* Allows specification of defaults (method, response_template (for send_message) and results)
* Allows (almost fully!) specialising each expected case to use a different method/response[/result]
* Defaults to the two default message input types (private/stream) now specified in the class, but can be generalised by naming one dict entry (or specialising the default as in followup_response)
* Supports testing the multiple-response case (message -> send_*  x n)
* Supports code testing success/fail of the send_* functions

I've adapted test_followup.py as an example, but have a local test_poll.py which also makes use of these features.

There are some FIXMEs:
* Currently the result is always the default; I've not yet worked on how to resolve this, if it can be;
* I'd like to optionally have the message->response be output, which is useful when debugging tests.

Also, I'm sure there is mypy tags to adjust, but I wanted to get this out to be looked over!",neiljp,None,2017-06-21T16:31:55Z,2017-07-07T23:35:16Z
5487,The REST API allows creating bots with empty username,"# Description

Using the `/bots` endpoint in the REST API, it's possible to create a bot with an empty username, which results in it having `-bot@<domain>` as the email address.

# Steps to reproduce

1. Start the development server.
2. Get an API key for Iago, using the `/dev_fetch_api_key` endpoint:

        curl -X POST -F 'username=iago@zulip.com' \
            http://localhost:9991/api/v1/dev_fetch_api_key

3. Send an HTTP POST request to the `/bots` endpoint, using Basic auth (`iago@zulip.com:<api_key>`), and the following form-data content in the body:

       full_name: ""Foo""
       short_name: """"

    For instance, using cURL:

       curl -X POST -u 'iago@zulip.com:<api_key>' \
           -F 'full_name=Foo' -F 'short_name=' \
           http://localhost:9991/api/v1/bots

4. The server will reply with an HTTP 200 status code (success).
5. The result is a bot with an empty `short_name`, that looks like this in the bot settings UI:

    ![Bot with empty username](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7356565/27352532-59a34794-5601-11e7-8427-b35e4fddfc06.png)

Meanwhile, the server should reply with an HTTP 400 (bad request), and an error message indicating that the format is invalid:

    {""result"":""error"", ""msg"":""Bad name or username""}

First, when you click on the chevron to activate the message actions popover, and then click on the chevron again, the popover closes, but the chevron is still there, even though it should disappear. (This is #4329)
The same bug applied for the emoji popover, though I don't think we had an issue open for this.

Also, when you clicked on any of the options in the message actions popover, the chevron still persisted until you clicked somewhere else. That was actually caused by a slightly different problem.

Finally, when you clicked on the ""copy link to conversation"" option, the keyboard shortcuts stopped working (#5374). This happened because the Clipboard library changes focus to some hidden textarea as their strategy for copying text.

```

The alternative, which is probably a better solution, is to finish removing Guardian.  It's been several releases since we stopped using/supporting it, so I think what we could do is this:
* Add some sort of code in `upgrade-zulip` for checking if the old version is 1.3.10 or older, and if so, telling them to upgrade to 1.4.3 before upgrading to the current version (don't recommend 1.4.0 since it's buggy).
* Use `manage.py squashmigrations` to eliminate the need for existing servers to access guardian
* Remove guardian from `INSTALLED_APPS`.

Doing a quick investigation using `manage.py squashmigrations zerver 0080`, I find a good number of migrations that have custom code we'd need to audit for whether it's needed on a new system.  Probably most of it is not, since they're mostly about fixing issues if you were installed with an older Zulip version.
```
# Functions from the following migrations need manual copying.
# Move them and any dependencies into this file, then update the
# RunPython operations to refer to the local versions:
# zerver.migrations.0011_remove_guardian
# zerver.migrations.0021_migrate_attachment_data
# zerver.migrations.0029_realm_subdomain
# zerver.migrations.0032_verify_all_medium_avatar_images
# zerver.migrations.0033_migrate_domain_to_realmalias
# zerver.migrations.0037_disallow_null_string_id
# zerver.migrations.0041_create_attachments_for_old_messages
# zerver.migrations.0057_realmauditlog
# zerver.migrations.0060_move_avatars_to_be_uid_based
# zerver.migrations.0064_sync_uploads_filesize_with_db
# zerver.migrations.0074_fix_duplicate_attachments
# zerver.migrations.0077_add_file_name_field_to_realm_emoji
# zerver.migrations.0079_remove_old_scheduled_jobs
```

So I think what we would do for now is:
* Add the old-version check to the upgrade process noted above for versions below 1.4.0 (last August).
* Make a `manage.py squashmigrations 0028` migration, verify the resulting database structure (can probably create a database, skip `populate_db`, do a pg_dump sort of thing, and compare before/after?), and delete migrations 0001 through 0027.
* Test production install still works happily.
* As a follow-up, consider doing squashmigrations through some later point like 0080.

5412,Some of codeblock typeahead doesn't work,"There are some codeblock typeaheads (from pygments) that doesn't work when I try it in Zulip, such as `c#`, I think `c#` breaks the codeblock syntax since there is an `#` in it. Btw, we could use `csharp` for alternative of `c#`.

~~--And why there's a `pycon` typeahead, I think it's not a programming language?~~
Edit: `pycon` is a abbreviation of `python console` so it's a normal behaviour

I think we could solve this by removing them (typeahead that doesn't work) from codeblock typeahead list (`tools/setup/lang.json`), and some places that generate those typeaheads..

5391,Add /404 and /500 URLs to development environment for previewing error pages,"Similar to the effort to make it easy to preview our emails, it'd be awesome to provide an easy way to preview our 404 and 500 pages in development, rendered as they would be in production.

There's 2 versions of each page:
* The versions served by nginx, already accessible at: http://127.0.0.1:9991/static/html/404.html and http://127.0.0.1:9991/static/html/5xx.html, which we should just add to the list of handy design links that includes `/emails/`.  These are only used in `/static/` (for 404) or if Django is down entirely (for 5xx).
* The versions served by Django (and thus relevant most of the time).  For these, we either (1) need to create new URLs that just serve the error templates, or (2) do little hack to disable the debug-mode 404/5xx pages that the Django dev environment serves (e.g. setting DEBUG=False in some view).  (1) seems like a better answer.

The situation is somewhat like this. We start a template tag and continue adding stuff. This is the place our `<pre>` tags is added. After adding these we add a html block tag with actual block body. Now since we would need to indent the body of template tag, earlier we were indenting `<pre>` as well but actually don't want to change indentation of `<pre>` tags at all because of rendered formatting issues. Since we didn't left `<pre>` tag alone else where in code and indenting it here resulted in a cyclic indentation requirement.",adnrs96,None,2017-06-13T05:45:49Z,2017-06-13T12:41:56Z

5312,[More...] tags are appearing on every message rendered in the background,"I've noticed as of Zulip 1.6.0 `[More...]`tags are appearing on every message that's beed loaded offscreen while Zulip was in the background.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. open https://chat.zulip.org
2. scroll down to the bottom of `Home`
3. leave it running in a background tab for 10+ min and let new messages accumulate without interacting with the tab 
4. come back to zulip, and scroll down
5. all (almost all?) new messages that were loaded below the scroll point will have `[More...]` tags, despite being short messages

Clicking the `[Condense this message]` confirms that the expanded and condensed versions are same height & same content.

Confirmed in `Chrome >=v59` & `Electron` consistently for me, and `Firefox` occasionally for [Reid](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/issues/subject/.5Bmore.5D.20tags.20on.20every.20message/near/219667).

**The Fix:**
This likely has to do with how zulip computes the height of messages by rendering them first, then getting the height off the rendered html element.
If you can find that code, just run a test using `setTimeout` to make sure it's reporting non-zero heights when rendering in the background in `Chrome` and `Firefox`.
If it does report 0px heights when background rendering, check to make sure it's using `getBoundingClientRect` and not `outerWidth`/`innerWidth`, which have issues with 0px reporting.

The typeahead system puts in bold the part of the suggested results that matches your query.

When you're typing a stream name the compose box, this highlighting feature doesn't work if your query contains a space.

# Steps to reproduce
1. Log in as Iago.
2. Create a new stream called ""foo bar"".
3. Go to the compose box to ""create a new topic"".
4. In the ""Stream"" field, type ""foo "" (foo and a space).
5. Notice that, as soon as you type the space, the bold in the suggestion at the typeahead box disappears.

zxcvbn already provides more detailed messages for passwords that are too weak, like `this is a top-10 common password` (see result.feedback on https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn), which we should expose to the user.

4961,Assert at end of if statement does not help mpyp value inference,"While working on making zulip pass with `mypy --strict-optional`, I ran into the following piece of code. Mypy was essentially saying that message.get_realm() was not guaranteed to work (""Not all parts of the union have get_realm() method"", or somesuch.)

```
if message is None:
    message = Message.objects.select_related().get(id=message_id)

rendered_content = render_markdown(message, content, realm=message.get_realm())
```
Let's assume, at least for here, that the get() call will never return None. I tried the following change, but mypy was still giving the exact same error:

```
if message is None:
    message = Message.objects.select_related().get(id=message_id)
    assert message is not None # ADDED

rendered_content = render_markdown(message, content, realm=message.get_realm())
```

However, with this change, mypy was now happy with the code snippet:

```
if message is None:
    message = Message.objects.select_related().get(id=message_id)

assert message is not None # ADDED, but outside the if, now.
rendered_content = render_markdown(message, content, realm=message.get_realm())
```

The two asserts clearly have the same code behavior of making it impossible for `message` to be `None` when we reach the `rendered_content = ...` line, but mypy only understands that currently (version 5.111) for the last code snippet only. Opening this bug report for discussion of that.

As a relatively naive user, it wasn't obvious why the date wasn't there (or how to get it back), which left me confused about when a discussion actually happened.

[Tim says](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/issues/subject/date/near/205010):  It's somewhat tricky, since it's only relevant when the floating recipient bar is hidden due to what would be an ugly overlap with the top message's recipient bar, but this means that we'd need to modify the styling of the top message in view to show the date temporarily. But I think should be fixable with a bit of work.

* Remove the realm emoji ""foo""

The one will get a lot of unpleasant bugs.  There's basically 2 strategies we can take to deal with this:
(1) Change realm emoji to be referenced in the code by ID, and just deactivate (rather than deleting) them when a user deletes a realm emoji in the admin UI.  That way, existing ones can still be rendered, and the ""delete"" button just stops you from creating new uses of that emoji.
(2) Delete any reactions using a given emoji when the emoji is deleted.  Seems kinda ugly.
(3) Just ignore unknown emoji names in the frontend code, etc.

I think I like the (1) approach to solving this problem best, since it feels like it'd probably produce the best user experience with the most robust implementation.

4699,CSS: Change color and styling of @-mentions.,"The original hope here was to get rid of the colored background entirely, and I have my best attempt at something that does that at https://github.com/rishig/zulip/tree/pm-colors-exploration-1. The main issue is that Zulip (at least chat.zulip.org) is busy enough with emoji, emoji reactions, blue links, pasted images, code blocks, etc that in order for a highlighted (or bubbled, or whatever) name to stand out it has to grab visual attention in a way that is then too ugly for the @-mentions narrow.

There might be other ways of indicating an @-mention other than {something localized to the name, background color}. I did not explore that.

In terms of choice of background color -- the color chosen is not really in-line with our green-blue ocean theme, but it also needs to look distinct from the PM background color. I tried to choose a color that was as bland as possible, while still being sufficiently different from white and the PM color. 

For the green text color - I wanted something that wasn't the blue link color, but sort of similar. It's not as saturated as the blue link color; that's easy to change if we think the non-you-@-mentions should have more (or less) prominence than they do in this PR. 

For the box-shadow - it would be nice to avoid it (and use a highlight, like slack), to make them not look like our buttons. Without at least some box-shadow though it's hard to make multiple @-mentions in a row look good, which I think is a common-enough case. Slack uses usernames without spaces, which solves this problem for them.

If people like this, some followups are:
    * Pick an emoji-reactions background color that works with this color
    * Fix the existing bug where the background-color here has higher z-index than the edge of the message box
    * Figure out how to make an at-message in a PM look good.
    * Change color of code blocks (transparent? grey?) to make them work with @-mention background and PM-background.

I could also imagine tweaks to the colors. A less intense background color might be `hsl(47, 70%, 96%)`. ",rishig,b'needs review',2017-05-06T07:20:38Z,2018-03-02T19:29:38Z

https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/master/static/images/logo/zulip-icon-128x128.png

That's because our markdown processor thinks anything that ends in `.png` is an image file.

There are two steps to solving this issue:
* Brainstorm a list of sites that have URLs ending in image file names that aren't actually the images. It's fine if you don't get all of them, we can always add more as we think of them. You can look at zulip.org/integrations to get an idea for other version control sites that might have similar behavior to github, and post to #general on chat.zulip.com. 
* Modify `zerver/lib/bugdown/__init__.py` to not mark URLs from those domains as images. This is likely the piece of code that will need to be modified:
```

4655,Unread count in bankruptcy modal doesn't match unread counts elsewhere,"I unsubscribed from some streams which still had unread messages in them.  I then caught up on all other streams by narrowing to them.  Result:

- The favicon, the page title, and the ""Home"" row in the stream list pane all claimed that I had 0 unreads.
- Upon reloading the page, I was offered to declare bankruptcy on 950+ unreads.
- Upon declining bankruptcy, the home view scrolled to old unread messages in the unsubscribed streams.
- I tried manually scrolling forward a few messages in the home view, waiting a few seconds for sync, and then reloading the page.  After reload, the message cursor consistently returned to where I had just left it, and the unread count in the bankruptcy modal had the following behavior:
  - It always decreased by at least the number of unreads I had marked read.
  - It often decreased even if I had only scrolled past read messages, but by fewer than the total number of messages I had scrolled past.
  - If I reloaded immediately before reading a block of unreads and also immediately after, the bankruptcy counter decreased by exactly the number I marked read; this didn't ""shake loose"" any other phantom unreads.
- Eventually I was no longer offered bankruptcy, but the cursor still didn't automatically scroll forward to the end of the home view.

This seems consistent with the bankruptcy modal's unread count coming from the visible unsubscribed unreads in the home view plus invisible unsubscribed messages in muted topics.

I know the cursor behavior is expected, and I'd guess unread messages predating unsubscription are intentionally visible in the home view.  But it seems as though both unread counts are wrong: the bankruptcy modal apparently counts muted messages, and the unread count shown elsewhere doesn't include all visible unreads in the home view.  In any event, it's confusing that the bankruptcy modal's unread count doesn't match the one in the rest of the UI.",bgilbert,b'area: misc bug',2017-04-30T06:02:00Z,2019-08-26T21:15:18Z

We definitely need to fix this.  Options include:
* Adding some mechanism to auto-delete the i18n caching entries with the oldest numbers in local storage if there are more than 5 such entries.
* Adding some time-based expiry mechanism.
* Something else

4367,Apostrophes should be allowed in bugdown tests,"# Description

When a fixture in `zerver/fixtures/markdown_test_cases.json` contains an apostrophe (`'`), the result produced by the frontend (Marked) and the backend (Bugdown) don't seem to match, since running the test with the `bugdown_matches_marked` flag as true produces an `AssertionError`.

# Steps to reproduce

1. Add the following key to `zerver/fixtures/markdown_test_cases.json`, inside the `regular_tests` array:

    ```
    {
        ""name"": ""test"",
        ""input"": ""it's lunch time"",
        ""expected_output"": ""<p>it's lunch time</p>"",
        ""bugdown_matches_marked"": true
    }
    ```
2. Run `./tools/test-js-with-node`.
3. The following error appears:

    ```
    assert.js:85
      throw new assert.AssertionError({
      ^
    AssertionError: '<p>it\'s lunch time</p>' == '<p>it&#39;s lunch time</p>'

    FAIL - Test(s) failed
    ```

# Additional information

At first sight, it could look like this is caused due to the frontend escaping apostrophes as `&#39;`, while the backend doesn't do it. However, if you try to type a message with an apostrophe just in local echo (with the server disconnected), the HTML directly contains the character, with no escaping whatsoever.

This is probably related to the `escape` functions defined either in `static/js/echo.js` or `static/js/third/marked/lib/marked.js`.

4337,Create maybe-down state for JS app.,"This is an advanced issue for an experienced Zulip developer.

When we come out of a suspended state in the browser, it can take a few seconds before we re-connect to the server's event system.  When that happens, we should explicitly note that state so that the app can query something like `events_healthy()` to make sure we're currently processing events.

If events are not yet obviously healthy, some pieces of code should not run until we confirm that we're processing events again.  The best example of this is our activity query that gets presence info for all users.  If we are behind on events, we may have not yet processed a `realm_user/add` event, and that unknown-to-us-yet user will cause us to throw a blueslip error.  (We could suppress the blueslip error, of course, but then we're blind to other bugs.)

Once we implement a maybe-down state, we should have a function like `channel.post_when_healthy()` that can defer server requests until the event system is known to be healthy again.  Conceptually, it would work as follows:

~~~ js
exports.post_when_healthy = function (...) {
    if event_system_is_healthy() {
        exports.post(...);
    } else {
        requests.push(...);
    }   
};

exports.on_events_back_up = function (...) {
    _.each(requests, function (req) {
        exports.post(...);
    });
};
~~~

And then our first use of the above code would be in `activity.js` for the bulk presence updates.

4323,markdown: Backend isn't rendering second level markdown.,"This is a work in progress.

There are couple of things to consider. The second level markdown works so as long as 4 spaces or a tab is used, but not t2 spaces. It seems this is correct according to what is stated in Python markdown docs https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/index.html#Features,

""The syntax rules clearly state that when a list item consists of multiple paragraphs, “each subsequent paragraph in a list item must be indented by either 4 spaces or one tab” (emphasis added)...The implementers of Python-Markdown consider it a bug to not enforce this rule. This applies to any block level elements nested in a list, including paragraphs, sub-lists, blockquotes, code blocks, etc. They must always be indented by at least four spaces (or one tab) for each level of nesting.""

So if I am to make the js markdown resemble the backend then either the js markdown must enforce the rule above, or the backend markup be adjusted to allow 2 space indentation. (The cheatsheat provided in Zulip docs specifies 2 spaces for nested lists.) Which approach should be taken?

4260,font: Ligatures like ff have strange behavior,"Copying conversation from https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/issues/topic/ligatures

--
If you type something with two f's and then left arrow back over it, you get somewhat strange behavior, since the ff is turned into a ligature. 
I managed to get stranger behavior as well by using backspace instead of left arrow, though I don't have a repro at the moment. If we turn off ligatures, would that break accented characters? (fwiw, slack and gchat seem to handle the ff case fine)

--
I have been able to reproduce the left arrow thing (or any other attempt of moving the cursor between both f's). The cursor stays after the last f, but if you type the text appears between them.
Something curious also happens if you click between both f's. The cursor should appear between the f's, but it doesn't. Actually, if you type new text, it appears after the ligature.

This happens in the compose box, search boxes, edit box, etc.

However, we don't update this designation if an inactive stream gets a new message after load.

4255,hotkeys: Add hotkeys for navigating Streams menu.,"* Adds hotkeys for left/right arrow keys to switch tabs in Streams menu (#4228)
* Adds hotkey `U` to subscribe/unsubscribe from selected stream in Streams menu (#4229)
* Moves cursor to ""Filter streams"" input if current selected stream is the first in the Streams menu (#4227)
* Adds hotkey `V` for viewing/narrowing to messages of selected stream in Streams menu

**To-do:**
* [x] When you open the streams page the first time, the ""filter streams"" text box should already have focus.
* [x] Is ""U"" the best key for ""subscribe/unsubscribe""?  I'm now wondering whether we should do ""S"" instead.
* [x] Let's open an issue for the fact that unsubscribing with hotkeys while in the 'Subscribed' tab needs to disappear the row; I don't think that's optimal and probably reflects some sort of subtle bug in how that page works.  
* [x] Right now, we're fetching subscribers from the server on every navigation, which could be really expensive.  I think we actually have all the data on the frontend to render subscribers without contacting the server.  I opened https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/4314 for this.

Previously, the edit button in *Users* section in _Administration_ panel wasn't showing the _user-form_ to edit the full name.

 `bot_data.get(person.email).owner`
This works perfectly if we are clicking the Edit button in Admin Bot Settings. But when you do the same in Admin User Settings, the line throws an error because the _get method_ returns undefined. This prevented the button from showing up.

**Fix:**
I have added an if condition in _admin.js_ which checks whether **person.is_bot** is true before executing the line. This fixes the bug.

Error logs are written in `var/log/errors.log`, and has other stuff, but is missing this traceback from the `/` view.  I think there's a few things we need to fix:
* We should try to detect that casper error in the Casper output and suggest it's likely the result of a 500 loading the `/` page, since that casper output is super confusing.
* We should make sure that exception gets into the the server logs.  I think the issue is actually constrained to the `/` URL -- for some reason exceptions there don't go anywhere in development (you don't need to be doing casper testing to reproduce it).

(And these races aren't down-to-the-millisecond kind of races, these are races where be both open stream settings, and one of us finishes the processes a few seconds before the other.)

3999,lint: Add lint rules that make it harder to introduce naive timezones.,"Naive timezone objects are dangerous, since they can cause bugs that happen for only 1 hour a year (daylight savings time), or can cause unexpected behavior when users or servers move timezones. See https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code-style.html#naive-datetime-objects for more information.

We'd like to add lint rules that do the following:
* Block the strings `utcnow`, and `utcfromtimestamp`
* Block `datetime.now` and `pytz` except in `api/`, `docs/`, `puppet/`, and `scripts/`
* `datetime.now()` must have a `tz` argument in `api/`
* `fromtimestamp()` must have a `tz` argument
* `tzinfo` and `tz` can never have the argument 'None'
* `strptime(..)` must be followed by `.replace(tzinfo=`
* Block `from timezone.utils.timezone import`

The linters are all in `tools/lint-all`. All errors should point folks to https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code-style.html#naive-datetime-objects.

I'm not too familiar with writing lint rules, so if any of these are hard, post in the comments or on chat.zulip.org, and we can replace with a simpler heuristic. ",rishig,b'area: tooling good first issue help wanted',2017-03-09T03:05:49Z,2017-03-14T21:40:59Z

3972,Change bugdown emoji rendering to use the sprite sheet rather than hardcoded URLs,"Now that we have sprite sheets for emoji in Zulip, we should use them for the actual emoji in messages, not just in the compose/reactions emoji pickers.

We can do this by changing the markup for emoji to a similar sprite sheet type of styling to what we use in the compose emoji picker and reactions emoji picker ( e.g. `<span class=""emoji emoji-lemon"" title=""lemon"">:lemon:</span>`), and then we can just change this by toggling whether that type of span shows an image or the text, without needing to hack the HTML (by default, the text would be hidden, but then with the ""show emoji as alt text"" setting, they would just display as text).

We should change the missed-message email templates to either (1) do the current thing if the setting is enabled or (2) Let users know that the email was sent from a noreply email address and thus one cannot reply directly, in the email.

3933,async/await checks are too aggressive and even escape `type: ignore`,"I happen to use a third-party library (Mandrill) that has various functions that take the `async` keyword:

https://mandrillapp.com/api/docs/index.python.html

The error is this, and it applies even if you add a `type: ignore` on the affected line:
`/tmp/foo.py:1: error: 'async' and 'await' will become reserved keywords in Python 3.7`

```
def foo(async=True):                                                                                 
    pass

```

You get the same thing with even this:
```
x = dict(async=False)  # type: ignore                                                                
```

Other keywords don't have this problem (`x = dict(type=False)` works fine), so I think this is just a bug with this new friendly check for new keywords.

This is basically a blocker for upgrading to mypy 0.501 for us, since I don't think there's a clean workaround (I could change to passing **{'async': False'}, but that's kinda absurd).",timabbott,None,2017-03-04T23:31:16Z,2017-03-04T23:31:40Z

3915,Show a pretty-printed diff of the full strings in bugdown tests' errors,"(Make sure you've read zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/markdown.html to understand this issue).

# Description
Right now, when a test in the strings checked in `zerver/fixtures/markdown_test_cases.json` doesn't match what it should, `test-js-with-node` (aka the frontend tests) raises an `AssertionError`, with a small diff of the conflicting strings:

```
assert.js:85
  throw new assert.AssertionError({
  ^
AssertionError: 'foo' == 'bar'
    at /srv/zulip/frontend_tests/node_tests/echo.js:156:14
    ...
```

However, when the strings are longer it's hard to identify the difference between them because they aren't readably organized. 

The same issue exists with the backend markdown tests as well, with the added problem that if they're long enough, they get truncated (which can potentially skip the difference between both strings).

```
AssertionError: '<p><span class=""katex-display""><span class=""katex""><span class
=""katex-mathml""><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant=""nor == '<p><span 
class=""katex-display""><span class=""katex""><span class=""katex-mathml""><math>
<semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant=""nor
```

# Additional information
The truncation problem in the backend Bugdown probably depends on the `maxDiff` setting; we may be able to fix it in general by updating the Bugdown test classes.

For the pretty-printing HTML diff, it's not clear what is required, but it might be worth looking at how Markdown processors write their own unit tests (for `marked.js` and `python-markdown` to see if they have a good solution for this that we can just import)",YagoGG,b'area: markdown area: testing-infrastructure help wanted',2017-03-03T21:29:46Z,2017-12-19T00:04:25Z

```
six==1.10.0
mypy==0.501
typed-ast==1.0.1
```
* Run `tools/provision`
* Run `tools/mypy`

* Fix the errors!

Until we can debug and fix the leak, I think it's worth building a quick tool that will kill lost uwsgi processes.  One can tell that a process is lost if it is not a child of the supervisord process.  

One can find all uwsgi processors via e.g. `pgrep -f '/etc/zulip/uwsgi.ini'`; so the tricky part will iterating through those processes and checking which descend from a supervisord process.  `pstree -ap` sorta does this logic, but I don't want to be parsing the output from that :).

3809,"Replace naive datetimes in the asana, basecamp, and codebase integrations.","Zulip is almost a 100% timezone-aware codebase! These are some of the last files with naive datetimes. The problem with naive datetimes is that they tend to fail or produce weird results during daylight savings time, or if the bot server changes timezones (e.g. if the server is running on someone's laptop). 

For each file, the goal is to change 
* `datetime.utcnow`s to `datetime.now(tz=pytz.utc)` (the same timetuple as `datetime.utcnow`, but now it has the timezone set), or to `time.time()` (number of seconds since epoch). 
* If going to `datetime.now(tz=pytz.utc)` route, also replace things like `fromtimestamp` and `utcfromtimestamp` with `datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp, tz=pytz.utc)`.

The main way these can fail is if elsewhere in the file we subtract or compare a naive datetime to this value, in which case that naive datetime should also have its timezone added.

You can find the files with `git grep utcnow` from the `api` directory. (Depending on when you do this, there may be other `utcnow`s, but they are being taken care of in other issues.)

3707,Make it possible to have more whitespace between paragraphs in Zulip messages,"Currently, there's basically no reasonable way to compose a Zulip message with a proper paragraph break between two pieces.  What we'd like to do is have:
```
foo
bar
```
continue to just put a `<br>` tag in between, but 

```
foo

bar
```

(which currently in the rendered HTML just places the two pieces inside separate `<p>` tags) should have more space in between paragraphs, ideally without adjusting the spacing between other things (e.g. height of a 1-line message, spacing between text and a code block, etc.).

There are two approaches we can take on this:
(1) Adjust the CSS to make spaces between two `<p>` tags in message bodies look right.  This may be difficult without changing other spacing, but is in theory possible.
(2) Instead, adjust the markdown processor to do something different (e.g. put a special paragraph divider element into the HTML that we can then add CSS for)

See http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/markdown.html for relevant notes on our markdown processor.

See https://github.com/chjj/marked/issues/726 for info on how one might do this in our frontend markdown processor (marked.js).

* [ ] Rename /#subscriptions to /#streams.  This is probably not too hard.

* [x] Add `/#streams/<streamid>-<streamname>` (e.g. `/15-design/`) for selecting a given stream.  Only the Stream ID would be actually used for lookups, so we don't need to worry about links breaking if a stream is renamed, but we'd have the stream name in there for human-readability.

The problem is, developers who are editing frontend templates probably aren't looking at their server logs, and thus are likely to experience this as ""why isn't my code updating"", which is confusing and frustrating.

I think it'd be pretty doable to do something like:
(1) compile-handlebars-templates writes to some stamp file under var/ when compiling fails (and removes it, when it succeeds)
(2) the home() route checks if that file exists, and if it does, displays an error page rather than loading the app; the error page can explain that their templates don't compile.

3631,Stream deletion is incredibly slow if you have a ton of users subscribed,"Reproduction recipe: 
* Use `manage.py populate_db --extra-users=1000` to create a Zulip development instance with 1000 users, who are subscribed to random subsets of the streams.
* Delete a stream using the /#administration UI for doing so.  It'll hang for like 10 seconds
* Check the run-dev.py logs; you'll see it did like 500 database queries and memcached queries, and probably the console will scroll for a really long time about all the rabbitmq events being processed as well.

I bet the main thing is just a simple database queries in loop bug, though I noticed that doing so also sent 1K events to rabbitmq (I think one for each user being unsubscribed), so we may need to restructure that to do a bulk event instead as well.  

For working on this, I'd uncomment the section in zproject/settnigs.py that says this: `# Uncomment the following to get all database queries logged to the console` so that Django logs every database query to the console; that'll make it pretty easy to see what we're doing N times.

Once fixed, we can add a test deleting a stream with like 10 users on it, using the `assert_num_queries` to assert that less than 10 database queries are done, so that this never regresses.

Probably we should just not be using a RegExp at all and just testing whether the term appears in the name, since I don't think we need regexps for the user-facing filtering logic here.

It would be better to instead have `:smile:` render directly to `<img alt="":smile:"" class=""emoji"" src=""/static/generated/emoji/images/emoji/unicode/1f604.png"" title="":smile:"">`, which doesn't tie us to our current set of names. This is important for being able to freely add/remove emoji shortcodes, i18n names, etc.

Places to look:
* `zerver/lib/bugdown.Emoji` is where the rendering happens, we just need to change the `src` variable in that code block.
* `tools/setup/emoji/build_emoji` is where the emoji mapping should be computed (`build_emoji` is run during provisioning). `dump_emojis` is the relevant function. I would add a dictionary to `emoji_codes_file` with the mapping from names to codepoint, that bugdown/ can then read from. Don't worry about the redundancy with the names array for now, or the redundancy with `emoji_map.json`.

After this change, all the `.png` symlinks in `/static/generated/emoji/images/emoji/` will be obsolete, though we still need to keep them for backwards compatibility with old messages. So let's leave them in place for now.

3465,Add downwards scrolling in narrows (relevant in rare cases),"@neerajwahi reported an interesting and subtle issue in how Zulip handles narrowing.  It's hard to catch in actual usage (just because the sorts of narrowing situations where it occurs are unusual), but the easiest way to reproduce this is to narrow to @-mentions, scroll up a lot, and then click on the **stream** (not the topic) of a message in a high-traffic stream, and then scroll down.  After about 50 messages, scrolling will stop, with no evidence there are more messages below.

http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pointer.html is mandatory reading to understand the below.

Here's why this happens:
* When a browser loads, we fetch into the local cache (and display in the home view) around 1600 messages of history near the user's pointer (where they last left off), and then keep fetching additional history forward until we get to the present.
* When narrowing, we immediately render what can be rendered using the cache, and then fetching ~50 messages in each direction from the message that was clicked on (or the first unread message, if narrowing from the left sidebar and there are any, etc., see the doc above).
* In any view, if you scroll up, we fetch more messages as needed from the server.
* When a user narrows by clicking on e.g. the left sidebar, everything is fine, because the above means messages all the way through current will be present in the home view cache.  However, if one instead scrolls down, we currently don't fetch any more messages from anywhere.  

But if you follow the recipe above, and the 1000 messages of history above the pointer isn't enough to meet the 50 messages below the message you clicked on in that narrow that we fetch from the server, one ends up with a gap and will get buggy behavior.

The correct fix is to add automatic loading of more messages as you scroll down as well, though only active in cases where doing so will actually fetch more messages (almost always, we will be able to be confident it won't, because e.g. when we fetched messages from the server, there weren't 50 past the point we clicked on) to avoid unnecessary loading indicators.

We can probably use the same styling we have for marking the top of the feed and showing a loading indicator there today (with the row with a black Z logo in it).

From looking up the line number, the actual code in question is this (see the `trim()` line there):

Looking at the lines in that code path, I think what's happening is that the success handler in `ajaxSubscribe` is calling `actually_filter_streams`, but the streams modal isn't open.  

This makes sense, because ajaxSubscribe is also called from e.g. the ""subscribe"" buttons at the bottom of a narrow to a stream you're not subscribed to.

So I think we just need to add a check in that success handler for whether the streams modal is open at the time before calling `actually_filter_streams`.",timabbott,b'area: stream settings bug good first issue help wanted',2017-01-19T19:30:23Z,2017-01-19T22:27:05Z

    return matching_reactions.map(function (reaction) {

```

Which means that we're somehow calling `message_store.get()` on a message ID not present in message_store, despite the fact that the message is currently displayed for the user.

```
# PR submission checklist

Thanks for contributing to Zulip!  Here's a quick checklist you can follow to help your changes be merged quickly:

* Review your own pull request, and fix typos, messy whitespace, etc.
* Confirm your commit(s) follow Zulip's version control and commit message guidelines.
* Make sure your changes pass the linter/tests, even for changes to things like documentation.  They're fast and catch a lot of little mistakes.
* Make sure you've updated the user docs (templates/zerver/help/) for any new or significantly modified features.
* Test your changes manually (link), including corner cases; try to find any bugs in it!
* If your work is reasonably testable (esp. backend changes or JS logic changes), does it have automated tests?
* If you're changing UI, post a screenshot or short video showing what it looks like; this makes discussing the visuals of your changes much more efficient.

If anything is missing, please mention it in the PR description, so that reviewers know what to expect (and possibly also tag your PR as ""WIP"" to indicate it's not ready to be merged yet).  E.g. a ""totally untested"" comment is much better than just not discussing testing.

It's not entirely clear what the right solution is here.  One direction we could investigate is in the message rerendering code path, check if there are any popovers hanging off of the elements being rerendered, and if so move what they are hanging off of.  I'm not sure that's possible with the popover library we're using (from bootstrap 2.x), but if we can get that to work, it would nicely solve this category of problems (which we've had several of, e.g. #2281).",timabbott,b'area: emoji bug good first issue help wanted',2017-01-03T19:08:54Z,2017-01-12T23:07:47Z

It would be great to no longer have to store the realm_str in the session, since it increases the security impact of a `SESSION_KEY` leak. I imagine the way to do this will be to pass the realm (or realm_str) through the google auth / github auth paths in `zerver/views/auth.py`, either as a parameter or by maintaining the URL. Most of the work for maintaining the URL has already been done as a part of the subdomains project over the summer.

2734,Frontend regression managing the pointer with local echo and USE_WEBSOCKETS=False,"In the last couple days I've noticed a new issue that goes as follows:
* I send a message
* I immediately advance the pointer onto the locally echoed message (hard to do, and probably impossible to do locally, since it's a race against message delivery latency).
* The message finishes sending and is delivered to my browser (adding the timestamp in the upper-right).  This rerenders the message, and appears to defocus the message (that last bit is new).

I bet we can reproduce this reliably by just making `do_send_messages` have a 10s sleep at the start so that there's plenty of time to win the race to complete step 2 before step 3 happens.

@brockwhittaker I'm guessing this was introduced in your recent focus changes; can you investigate?

UPDATE: We've confirmed that this only happens if `settings.USE_WEBSOCKETS` is disabled (at the time of the bug report, websockets were accidentally disabled for everyone due to another bug).

2640,Add realm-level settings to control inline image/open graph previews,"Currently, we have two server-level settings in zproject/settings.py:
* INLINE_URL_EMBED_PREVIEW (controls open graph previews).
* INLINE_IMAGE_PREVIEW (controls inline image previews).

We'd like to make controlling these available as be realm-level settings, since I suspect some organizations will want these features enabled or disabled for their organization.  The actual flag can be done inside Bugdown without too much trouble -- we already pass in a bunch of realm metadata when constructing the markdown object, so the main work here is actually creating a setting.

We can keep the existing server-level settings (I can imagine some server administrators not wanting these features available on their server at all); if the server-level setting is disabled, we'd just hide the option from realm administrators.

I've tagged this as bite-size because even though it's a moderately sized project, it doesn't require any knowledge not covered in the ""new application feature"" tutorial and markdown docs on RTD.

(We'll perhaps want to have a user-level setting to control this, but that would be at the display layer, not the markdown layer).",timabbott,b'area: markdown area: settings (admin/org) good first issue help wanted',2016-12-08T01:56:45Z,2017-03-21T22:47:36Z

2607,missedmessage_emails queue worker can backlog when inviting many users to a stream,"Currently, if someone creates a new stream and invites all 500 people in an organization (which is a reasonable thing to do sometimes), we send a PM to all 500 people, which often generates an email.  Zulip's message sending infrastructure handles this fine, but then we end up with a backlogged outgoing email queue, since sending outgoing emails is an expensive operation, intentionally made slow by providers to prevent spam.

We can't easily just parallelize the missedmessage queue worker, because it does 2 things: aggregation/construction of the emails and the actual email delivery.

I think the structural thing we want to do here is the following:
* Modify `do_send_missedmessage_events_reply_in_zulip` to put emails in a new queue worker to be sent, rather than actually sending them.  I think this might be most simply implemented by just having the `missedmessage_emails` queue worker write things out to a new queue after its every-2-minutes drain+aggregate operations.
* Add a new `missedmessage_email_senders` queue that actually sends the messages; we can then configure things to support having multiple workers processing that queue.

2605,"Check all for invite-only stream after filtering users, checks ALL users","So I discovered this making an invite only stream, I copy and pasted a list of emails from a private message thread (to make a stream out of it). That filtered the user list to those I wanted to be invited, but then when I clicked check all (because only those I filtered out where there) I inadvertently invited everyone to the invite only thread (which besides being deeply ironic, was slightly awkward). 

I realize this is how the check all feature works, it checks all, so instead of changing that, maybe one could check if an invite only stream really needs to invite ALL users (similar to before you @mention all, there is a little warning). Or perhaps the check all feature should indeed only check those who are filtered out? I've got some time in my hand (but not much javascript under my belt), so I'll take marching orders 😸 ",fenimore,b'area: stream settings bug good first issue help wanted',2016-12-05T19:30:43Z,2017-01-13T22:12:11Z
2604,"Creating an invite only stream, stream isn't added to Streams list - needs page refresh","Hi,

So when I create an invite only stream, it doesn't get added to the streams list, I think it's because of this if statement, inside`create_stream_if_needed` :

        if not invite_only:
            event = dict(type=""stream"", op=""create"",
                         streams=[stream.to_dict()])
            send_event(event, active_user_ids(realm))


And so if the stream is created invite-only, the event isn't sent out.

I was thinking to get the subscribers of the stream and send the event out to them, but the subscribers aren't yet subscribed, so that `set` of user ids (from `get_subscribers`) is empty ... 

So there is some strange behaviour because of this:

Say, Aaron creates an invite-only stream and invites Zoe; Aaron refreshes his page and @ mentions Zoe in the invite-only stream (she has not yet refreshed the page, and this stream is not visible to her). Zoe's @mention does not receive a little tag `1` indicating that she has a new @mention. If she checks that `narrow`, however, she does see an @mention from that stream. When trying to reply, she is able, even though she gets a message saying: ""you are unsubscribed, here is the subscribe button"".

Also, the notifications created in `add_subscriptions_backend` , indicated someone has been subscribed to a stream, only appear when the page is refreshed. ie, see these lines from this method:

                for stream in subscriptions:
                    msg += ""* [%s](%s)%s\n"" % (
                        stream,
                        stream_link(stream),
                        "" (**invite-only**)"" if private_streams[stream] else """")

This message doesn't appear...

So one option is simply to take out the if statement, and broadcast to everyone that there is a new stream (and only those who are subscribed will see it as ""visible""); the downside to this is that everyone gets an event declaring that there was this super secret stream created... So I figure that option is out.",fenimore,b'area: stream settings bug help wanted',2016-12-05T19:25:15Z,2017-03-22T06:15:57Z

2596,Creating streams with long names breaks UI in three places,"Creating streams with long names in the streams settings page leads to bugs at three different lengths. To reproduce this, 
1. Log in as Iago
2. Click on the gear icon and click on manage streams
3. Click on Create New Stream
4. Enter a long stream name and click on Create

## Overflow in error message
The error message that says the stream name is too long contains the stream name, which overflows past the error message box and covers the right panel UI (users). This occurs when the stream name is longer than 105 characters.

## Stream panel (left) chevron obscured
When the stream name is longer than 30 characters the chevron is obscured. Hover over the stream name in the stream panel on the left side of the screen to see this.

## Delete stream modal text overflow
Deleting a stream with a name longer than 50 characters results in the rest of the stream name overflowing (and hidden). It's not clear what behavior would be better than this. To reproduce,
1. Click on the gear icon, choose Administration
2. Click on Streams Deletion

```

2492,NonNumeric Django UserProfile Ids fail sort on Case Sensitivity ,"The users field for `window.activity.presence_info` is keyed by `email` on the recurse.zulipchat.com. When sort in `activity.js` is called, it creates object.keys that are case sensitive while all the emails are lower cased causing `undefined` lookups. Newer versions of Zulip on local dev show this is an numeric id object mapping now. 

Solution, migrate or to lower all the keys in `sort` or migrate keys run `tolower` in Django.

Steps to reproduce:

2. Scroll down to read all the messages in the newly focused stream. The total unread count for the stream will be cleared automatically, but (some? all?) of the unread counts for the individual topics are still shown.",nicholasbs,b'area: left-sidebar bug',2016-11-16T17:31:19Z,2016-11-16T18:31:36Z

> Your connection is not private
> The server presented a certificate that was not publicly disclosed using the Certificate Transparency policy. This is a requirement for some certificates, to ensure that they are trustworthy and protect against attackers.
> You cannot proceed because the website operator has requested heightened security for this domain.
Then if I click ""Help me understand"", it further specifies:
> When you connect to a secure website, the server hosting that site presents your browser with something called a ""certificate"" to verify its identity. This certificate contains identity information, such as the address of the website, which is verified by a third party that your computer trusts. By checking that the address in the certificate matches the address of the website, it is possible to verify that you are securely communicating with the website you intended, and not a third party (such as an attacker on your network).
> You cannot visit recurse.zulipchat.com right now because the website uses HSTS. Network errors and attacks are usually temporary, so this page will probably work later.
Going to the [opera://net-internals/#hsts](Opera page for managing HSTS) and putting zulipchat in the ""Delete domain"" box makes it work again.

Generally, we solve this by calling `popovers.hide_all();` at the start of various UI actions (or at the start of trigger event handlers).   This should be an easy change, with the following minor challenges:

* We want to avoid having lots of calls to `popovers.hide_all()` in our code, so we should be thoughtful about the best place to put these.
* When you're manually testing this fix, you should try to uncover similar bugs by doing things like narrowing from the recipient bar, searching, opening up other menus, etc.

2258,bug: Allow editing of new streams (in popup/overlay),"Here's the repro:

- as Cordelia, go to Manage Streams
- click on any existing stream, and it works
- create a new stream called ""foo"" and subscribe Hamlet (or whoever, prolly)
- clear the text box so you're not filtering
- click on an old stream, it works
- click on ""foo"" and it fails

You can eventually edit ""foo"" by either reloading the app or by leaving Manage Streams and re-entering it.

The source of the problem sees to be that we're failing to render subscription_settings.handlebars when we add the new subscription and attaching it some browser element.  Then, we subsequently fail here:

```
 372 exports.show_settings_for = function (stream_name) {
 373     var sub_settings = settings_for_sub(stream_data.get_sub(stream_name));
 374     var stream = $("".subscription_settings[data-stream-name='"" + stream_name + ""']"");
 375     $("".subscription_settings[data-stream].show"").removeClass(""show"");

The primary code paths are:
* zerver/lib/socket.py -- receives websockets requests from Tornado and puts them in the message_sender RabbitMQ queue.
* zerver/lib/queue_processors.py (the message_sender queue worker code, which processes the above and then sends a message)
(and of course the runtornado management command does the actual routing).

We currently do backend tests for our other uses of Tornado by just checking some settings (see send_notification_http) and just call the functions rather than going through a queue processor; I think we could use the same approach here to make it easy to write backend tests for this code path.

2091,Returning to stream narrow after reply marks all stream messages read,"Rough steps:
1. narrow to stream with `s`
2. see interesting message, narrow to topic with `s`
3. reply at end of topic (`r`, typey-type, `<enter>`)
4. return to stream narrow with `s`

**Expected outcome:** to be returned to my position before the topic narrow (step 2).

**Actual outcome:** returned to bottom of stream, with all intervening messages marked read.

**Background:** I'm often catching up on several hundred messages. I skim through the a few stream views, and hit `S` to narrow to a topic if I want to reply. After replying, hitting `s` to go back to the stream narrow drops me to the bottom of the stream and marks all messages in between as read.

I would prefer to go back to where I was before the topic narrow, and find losing my unread state frustrating.

This is different from the home view, where hitting escape after replying brings you back to where you were.

(I may have some of the behaviors mixed up because the ""state machine"" isn't super simple or intuitive.)

2008,Improve ordering of @mention suggestions,"This is an enhancement related to the bug in #2007. I frequently either almost pick or do pick the wrong person with $first_name in the drop down because the one I want isn't at the top.

There are a few relatively simple heuristics that could make this less likey. For example:
- if replying with a selected message, prioritise that message's author
- prioritise recent participants in the topic
- prioritise recent participants in the stream

There are less simple things like using my past mentions to seed the list. This may require extra per user state, and certainly per user processing. The above ones are just based on the view the user has.

(As a workaround, I've ended up learning some unique substrings in the full name + email address of people I mention frequently and won't show up near the top with a prefix.)

1858,Add bugdown syntax for linking a stream or stream+topic pair,"As has been mentioned a few times in discussions on Zulip, we should add a syntax for referring to a stream or stream + topic pair in Zulip.  

I think for streams we should do something like `#**stream name**`; for topics we may want to do something more like `#**stream name/topic name**` to match how we display them while still setting aside the syntax to be something special.    I'd probably start with just doing the stream name version though, and only add the topic one once we've actually played with the stream name syntax in production.

A major tricky issue that we will need to resolve is how we want to do escaping of the special characters involved here should they be present in stream/topic names (or if we instead want to limit the valid characters in stream names).  One option would be to just URL-encode the names.  

Finally, we'll want to have auto-complete for the feature so that it's easily discoverable and easy to work with.

1857,Improve testing of markdown.contains_backend_only_syntax(),"Currently, `echo.contains_bugdown` does a pretty good job of checking what bugdown is supported, but there are a few gaps.

However, we have some more obscure markdown features (e.g. `!modal_link()`) that are not checked for in the file.  We have some test data in `zerver/fixtures/markdown_test_cases.json` as well as tests in `zerver/tests/test_bugdown.py` and frontend tests in `frontend_tests/node_tests/echo.js`.  The test fixture data is preferred for new tests, since it is automated tested in both the test_bugdown and echo.js test suites.  

We should do a few things:
(1) Document the above notes on how we test bugdown in docs/markdown.md
(2) Fill the gaps where `markdown.contains_backend_only_syntax` does not produce correct output, and add tests for this.  The things I'm aware of include `!modal_link` and friends (see the issues below)
(3) Add a `blueslip.warn` call to report to the server whenever the local echo support ends up discovering a mismatch between marked and bugdown, so that we can catch future mismatches and fix or test them.

1836,Clean up email_mirror code.,"We should move these three methods (and possibly others) out of actions.py and into lib/email_mirror.py:
- get_email_gateway_message_string_from_address
- encode_email_address_helper
- decode_email_address

We can probably s/_helper// on the encode method.

We probably want `get_email_gateway_message_string_from_address` to just throw an exception if it can't find an email, and then let callers catch it as needed.  We could raise `ZulipEmailForwardError`, even though it's slightly misnamed for that failure scenario, or we could raise a new custom exception like `ZulipEmailUnrecognizedAddress`.

Finally, since exceptions are going to be pretty common here (they can happen due to bugs, but more commonly, hopefully, due to mis-configuration on the Zulip side or spam or users having email forwarding issues, etc.), we should probably try to catch exceptions in the outer layers of our system and do useful logging and error reporting.

> - Strongly recommending using gitk (Linux) or sourcetree (Mac) as a graphical git viewer and looking at it on either side of git operations to learn what you're doing
> - how to rebase and update your PR with GitHub and that you never leave to close and recreate a PR
> - how to fetch someone else's branch
> - that you need to comment after updating your PR for anyone to actually look at it for review
> 
> For anything where there's a good doc on GitHub/Atlassian/GitLab's site or a blog, we can probably just link, but it'd be good to collect the docs in one place.
> And then here's some stuff specific to our project
> - tools/setup-git-repo (once that's happy)
> - reset-to-pull-request and rebase-fetch-pull-request (be careful with them -- they blow away your current repo state when you run them and can lose work! but they make it easy to get code from someone else's branch)
> - How to sign up for Travis CI so that any branch you push gets auto-tested (and it emails you with whether it passed tests)
> - Linking to our testing documentation and encouraging people to run single tests when iteratively debugging something
> - Our WIP pull request convention

1581,Zulip Javascript modules not available in production environments,"In a Zulip production environment, we seem to have regressed the super-useful debugging featureset of being able to call functions from zulip's modules directly from the javascript console.  You can verify this by typing `page_params` in the javascript console on zulip.tabbott.net.

Interestingly, the browser will autocomplete field names like this, but actually trying to use them doesn't work:

```
page_params.password_auth_enabled
VM357:1 Uncaught ReferenceError: page_params is not defined(…)
```

(and my guess is the autocomplete is coming from the browser's history of what I've done in the javascript console, not the actual contents of the page_params object).

I'm guessing this somehow was introduced when we upgraded django-pipeline, and it's now eliminating the module exports in its minification.

I attempted to reproduce this in development by changing `PIPELINE_ENABLED=True` in a development environment, but that didn't work because `manage.py compilemessages` crashes with that setup; and after working around that, the development homepage didn't load, so I think we have some setup tools work to do in order to reproduce this for efficient debugging.

1539,Make all datetimes timezone aware,"Currently the code uses a mixture of `datetime.now()`, `datetime.utcnow()`, and django's `timezone.now()` to get/set datetimes to the current time. Though they seem similar, `datetime.now` and `datetime.utcnow` are ""timezone-naive"" datetime objects, meaning their timezone is open to interpretation, whereas `timezone.now` is a timezone-aware datetime object. Using timezone-naive datetimes can cause subtle bugs where we accidentally interpret a local datetime as UTC or vice-versa. As we start adding analytics to zulip, we may run into these bugs more frequently. 

To resolve this we simply have to replace all occurrences of `datetime.now` and `datetime.utcnow` with django's `timezone.now`. You can import it as `from django.utils import timezone`. Don't worry about changing the `datetime.now()`s in the `analytics/` directory, as that directory is being rewritten anyway.

This would be a great project for someone wanting to practice using `git grep`, editing tools, or wanting to make a first commit!

1530,Standardize dynamic CSS classes,"As part of #1511, I am trying to track down CSS classes which may no longer be in use, and one of the challenges is that certain CSS classes get dynamically applied to elements using jQuery's `addClass` method.   There's nothing intrinsically wrong with using `addClass` in our code, but it does make it a little more difficult to audit our CSS.  Also, from a debugging standpoint, it's nice to be able to easily distinguish which CSS classes might be behavior-driven, so that you can quickly hone in on why a certain element changed look and feel after doing some action.

I don't have a specific proposal on how to standardize the dynamic classes, but having some sort of conventions would probably make our code easier overall to understand.

Anyway, here is a non-exhaustive list of some dynamically added classes.  I basically found these by grepping through `static/js/*.js`, and these don't account for situations where we may first put the CSS class into a variable before calling `addClass`.

Once this hits master, I'll hit some of the more fiddly cases, like ist.mit.edu users and domains that end in ""irc"" (I think there's a very minor bug in the code that would impact a realm like blirc.com).

1419,parse and use parts of name + email combinations for new user invitations,"If I paste a contact from my email client into the invite field, it often looks like: `Erin Bar <foo@example.com>`. If I paste that directly into the ""invite new user"" email field and hit the invite button, I get this error:

```
Some emails did not validate, so we didn't send any invitations.

    Erin: Invalid address.
    Bar: Invalid address.
    <foo@example.com>: Invalid address.
```

It would be nice if Zulip could parse the invitee's name and email address appropriately out of that format, and send the email invitation with the name included in the `To:` field instead of just using the bare email address. (But I can see how trying to do this would be a headache for a lot of reasons.)

And the phrase ""start the conversation"" is a hyperlink; if I click it, a new message composition box appears. But I'm not Foo Bar, so me composing a message and posting it will not actually cause my search to have new results; ""Why not start the conversation?"" isn't the right message for this circumstance.

Suggested alternative:

> **This user hasn't posted anything yet!**
> 
> Why not ask them to join the conversation?

with ""ask them to join the conversation"" being a link -- clicking it should give the user a composition box pre-populated with an @-notification of Foo Bar's name.

1379,Untangle mutual dependency between models.Message and bugdown,"See this comment:

```
                    # We really shouldn't be rendering objects in this method, but there is 
                    # a scenario where we upgrade the version of bugdown and fail to run 
                    # management commands to re-render historical messages, and then we 
                    # need to have side effects.  This method is optimized to not need full 
                    # blown ORM objects, but the bugdown renderer is unfortunately highly 
                    # coupled to Message, and we also need to persist the new rendered content. 
                    # If we don't have a message object passed in, we get one here.  The cost 
                    # of going to the DB here should be overshadowed by the cost of rendering 
                    # and updating the row. 
                    message = Message.objects.select_related().get(id=message_id) 
```

For the reasons described there, we have to import bugdown in some methods of our Message class, using this pattern:

```
        global bugdown 
        if bugdown is None: 
            import zerver.lib.bugdown as bugdown 
            # 'from zerver.lib import bugdown' gives mypy error in python 3 mode. 
```

It happens in a few places, but the most concerning place is when we call build_message_dict() to help populate the cache.  It's tricky to test the re-render-messages-in-bugdown-on-the-fly logic, and it would have pretty serious performance implications if it had some sort of subtle bug, where, for example, it kept trying to re-render messages.

I think we can remove these hacks by adopting one of these policies:
- Allow historical messages to keep their original rendering from whatever version of bugdown they were rendered with.  (Given that bugdown is fairly stable at this point, I doubt there would be reasons to re-render all of the historical messages.)
- If we do need to re-rerender historical messages during any bugdown upgrade, enforce that this happens as part of the upgrade process, and don't lazily re-render messages during production.

1322,Convert update_user_profile_caches to just delete from the cache,"Based on the bug we uncovered in #1257, I think it probably makes sense to change `update_user_profile_caches` (and our other `flush` functions) to just delete from the relevant cache, rather than storing into it; if we do that, then Zulip's caching system will be more robust to races between different updates to the same model object (the `update_fields` code to use `UPDATE` queries rather than `SAVE` queries helps, but is incomplete).

However, we don't use all fields so it doesn't matter much. I think `urls` is the only field which we use whose format has changed. I have updated that field, which was necessary and sufficient for tests to pass.

Should we update the fields in the test data to the new format? Should we let them stay as they are? Or should we remove the fields we don't use so that we don't have to change our test data in the future if those fields change?

This bug was discovered by running `zerver.tests.tests.BotTest.test_deactivate_bot` in python 3.4. An assert failure used to occur because the response was <400 ""Insufficient permission"">. This happened because the bot's supposed-to-be-owner tried to deactivate the bot but he couldn't because he's not marked as the owner. The bot's `bot_owner` field is `None` so the bot doesn't have an owner.

It's possible this could be because of a bug in our code which only reveals itself in python 3.4. It'll be great if we can get to the bottom of this issue.

There's a bug here that we don't clear the redis server's data that the tests use.  So since the `zerver.tests.tests.TestMissedMessages.test_extra_context_in_huddle_missed_stream_messages` test uses a fixed set of redis keys, if that test crashes partway through at any point (e.g. because the user hit ctrl-C while the test was running) and thus doesn't clear the keys it sets through its normal completion process, we just leak that state in the redis server forever.  Possible solutions include:
- add code to clear the redis server between tests
- Do something like what we do with memcached of changing key prefixes on each test run
- probably a few other options

I think the second solution is probably going to be the simplest...

1209,Add a Topic model.,"This is a very raw set of commits, but it starts us on the road to having a zerver_topics table.

One thing that's immediately actionable is that I need somebody with some SqlAlchemy chops to help me figure out how to do narrowing queries on topic when we join to another table.  It's not rocket science, just beyond my own SA knowledge.  See fd22f2a.

This series of commits creates a Topic table, and it tries to make the back end behave mostly the same way.

I think we're pretty close to being able to have developers optimistically build features off of this branch, such as the following:
- Make muting topics have a less hackish DB representation than a comma-delimited list of strings.
- Send fewer strings over the wire to the front end.
- Take advantage of topic ids for HTML elements like topic bars in the message list.
- Add advanced features directly related to topics, like making them read-only, etc.

The one major place in the code that I've punted on so far is figuring out the semantics of topic name changes.  I've gained some insight on what to do there once we start discussion; I'm just too tired to elaborate now.

The biggest thing to figure out is probably how we change our backend caching strategy for messages in light of having a separate Topic table.  Some of my commits start to touch the cache, so we at least now have a concrete example to kibitz on.

Dealing with migration headaches is certainly out of scope for the current commit, but I do do a basic backfill for the dev environment.  To try to make devs able to track down bugs, I have a scheme where I corrupt message.subject on writes, so hopefully many failures will be more or less obvious.

Also, as vaguely alluded to above, I don't actually remove message.subject in this commit, and there are still some shims in the code that rely on it still existing.  I'm warming up to the idea that we should do a roll-out with two major changes--one to add the new table, and then another down the road to deprecate the old field.   But I'm only a couple hours into this experiment, so my views may change.

1196,Upgrade jquery to 1.11,"This would bring our version of jquery to be current, and likely result in various performance improvements!

The hard part will be upgrading to 1.9; in that 1.10 and 1.11 don't claim to have any backwards-incompatible changes.  See:
- https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/
- https://blog.jquery.com/2013/05/24/jquery-1-10-0-and-2-0-1-released/
- https://blog.jquery.com/2014/01/24/jquery-1-11-and-2-1-released/

From grepping through our codebase, here are a few 1.9 upgrade compatibility issues we'll need to solve:
- [x] Our version of `jquery-validate` seems to use `.add()` and a few other things.  We can probably just upgrade jquery-validate; they should support our current jquery version.
- [x] `.browser` (see #1033)
- [x] `static/js/setup.js:    $('body').ajaxError(function (event, xhr) {` should be using `$(document)`
- [x] prop vs. attr with `checked`:

```
(zulip-venv) tabbott@zaset:~/zulip$ git grep [.]attr | grep checked
static/js/invite.js:        $('#streams_to_add :checkbox').attr('checked', true);
static/js/invite.js:        $('#streams_to_add :checkbox').attr('checked', false);
static/js/subs.js:    not_in_home_view_checkbox.attr('checked', !value);
static/js/subs.js:    desktop_notifications_checkbox.attr('checked', value);
static/js/subs.js:    audible_notifications_checkbox.attr('checked', value);
static/js/subs.js:    pin_checkbox.attr('checked', value);
static/js/subs.js:        $('#people_to_add :checkbox').attr('checked', true);
static/js/subs.js:        $('#people_to_add :checkbox').attr('checked', false);
```
- [x] Grep for other `.attr` vs. `.prop` issues
- [x] .selector property used in bootstrap (may need to upgrade bootstrap?)
- [ ] ""jQuery.ajax returning a JSON result of an empty string"" -- this is annoying old jquery bug we have a bunch of workarounds for; we will be able to remove this after the upgrade.
- [x] test hotkey performance regression is solved (see beedfb29398f2d10e5f03c58f3cb428d24c06cc6)

  http://localhost:9981/static/js/blueslip.js:217
```

To provide a bit of relevant context, here's some notes on the 2 key lines inside the Zulip code:
- The hashchange.js:128 line is `$(document).trigger($.Event('hashchange.zulip'));`.  This line is a key part of how Zulip implements switching views within the single-page webapp (the hash changes whenever you narrow, go to the settings page, etc.).  If one deletes that line (just to see what happens), the site loads fine, but then changing tabs doesn't work so the tests will still fail starting with the narrowing tests.  
- `blueslip` is a Zulip-specific library for catching all javascript tracebacks and reporting them to the server.  Consequently, we have blueslip wrap basically every entry point within our javascript.  In theory, it should do nothing other than wrapping things inside a `try/except` in production.  Based on the next bullet, it appears the infinite loop here doesn't involve blueslip.
- The hashchange.js:176 line is inside the `hashchanged` function, which is called primarily from a `window.onhashchange` hook using blueslip around line 185 of that file:
  `window.onhashchange = blueslip.wrap_function(hashchanged);`.  If you remove the `blueslip.wrap_function` around `hashchanged`, the infinite loop still happens (and no longer has blueslip in the traceback).

So, in summary, I think somehow the `$(document).trigger($.Event('hashchange.zulip'));` call is resulting in the hash being (seen as?) changed; I don't understand the mechanism for this.

I'd be super excited if someone was able to debug this infinite loop issue!

1131,Use a commit message linter in CI,"It'd be great to have a commit message linter to check for common formatting errors; this would save a good amount of time reviewing code.  In practice, for Zulip, the common errors I see, in rough order of frequency:
- Not using a ""."" at the end of sentences
- Using a different tense than action-verb.  E.g. ""Fix foo"" is correct style for Zulip, not ""Fixed foo"" or ""Fixing foo"".
- Too long lines in commit messages
- No blank line between the subject and body of the commit message.

There are few technical challenges here:
1. Need to figure out how to access commit history from Travis CI (this may be difficult, so seems like the first thing to check).  If we can do that, it'd be trivial to at least code some of these manually.
2. Pick a tool to use.  I've looked into a few:
- https://jorisroovers.github.io/gitlint/ is a Python tool missing some key functionality )
  https://github.com/jorisroovers/gitlint/issues/14#issuecomment-228698842)
- https://github.com/marionebl/conventional-changelog-lint has a broader featureset, but seemed buggy when I played with it (was hard to override defaults that didn't match what we want). It's ""tense"" feature sounds valuable though.
1. Configure it and profit!

At the time of this writing commit https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/8cecb3774321adf638b93781a175e74e68a6564b is the latest version I used, so the error must have been between this commit and last commit for release 1.3.13.

When I reverted this commit https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/c74a74dc7427549eba4ececcf91c483ca2876796 everything compiled as normal. There must be a dependency that is pulled in that makes it work.

This also means we spend about 40s in our Travis CI tests for the `production` suite restarting services using supervisord.  This time is not time spent in Zulip -- the time is essentially all supervisord overhead.  We should figure out how to either patch or replace supervisord to be reasonably efficient.

https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Azbenjamin+is%3Aclosed has some work @zbenjamin did on supervisor performance a few years ago, but it seems despite some of that being merged, supervisor is still incredibly slow at restarting N processes.

The test case for this I would use is just running supervisord to start N `sleep 10000` commands.

1085,Stream List (left hand side list of all streams) Organisation Ideas.,"Hi,

I had a quick look through all the bug reports, so I hope I’m not repeating anything. I have a few things on my wish list for the stream list on the left hand side, and this only applies to that list of all streams and it's organisation.

The first is probably the easiest. I’d like to have muted streams moved to the bottom of the list below a line. A simple line like those on the right hand side to separate the “invite more users” text from “Group PM’s”. Also, they wouldn’t be greyed out like they are now as that’s difficult to see. The CSS can be modified to stop the greying out, but the stream would still be in the way, so to speak. Some companies may have a lot of teams, and some teams may even have more than one stream, so this adds up to a lot of streams. It may be that people in one team may need to talk with another, but don’t want to see that other’s teams posts in the home screen. Having the muted ones below a line would put all the streams that a user cares about together. If most are muted, it could create large gaps between stream names that are cared about. The user may not have the option to unsubscribe from a stream as they may need to interact with it eventually. This will filter the data to the home screen stream to just what a user cares about and list the streams in an order that is more convenient. This may just need a check on the variable if it’s muted or not.

The next idea may be a bit tricky: An option that allows certain streams to be at the top of the list. I don’t want to call this “sticky” as I don’t like the push pin icons, but the idea is there. This would be reserved for the main company streams, like maybe a Company Announcements or something. This would order those first, and maybe (this part needs discussing) if it should even be allowed to be unsubscribed from. That way, company news/whatever is right at the top where it looks important, but not necessarily meaning it is. ;) Maybe a way of controlling order, like a ranking system, so that the one that company thinks is most important is at the very top, despite alphabetical order, but the same “rank” would be alphabetical.

The third idea I had, and don’t know how doable it is, but have streams grouped. For example, if there is a robotics team, they may have “Robotics Announcements”, “Robotics Discussion”, “Robotics Software”… so on. I’m not sure what the UI would look like for the grouping, but it would need to be consistent with current stylings and include the features below. The streams belonging to that group would start right under it close to the text, then at the end of the group, a slight gap before the next group starts. The streams in a group then can have a “Pinned” stream to the top of the group list, but everything else in alphabetical order. Then there would just be “Announcements”, “Discussion”, “Software”… so on. Also, a way to expand or collapse a team. This would compact, sometimes a large list of streams to one line. Also, just clicking on the heading for the team would bring up a menu, like that of the individual streams, but mainly have expand/collapse and (un)mute. Muting the heading would mute the whole team, so it’s and easy way to control the noisiness of a grouping of streams.

Maybe, the first idea can be done by allowing the user choose rank order, except for the pinned ones by the company, then there own team can be first, then the team they communicate with more, down to the least? Grouping the streams by teams or department can then make the stream list more organized, and the streams in a group would not really need to be ranked but the user. Just the group ranking of where it is in the whole list. I kinda like the ranking idea over the first one, but the first one might be an easy first step to ordering the stream list.

The real world to these ideas is from a place that has about 20 teams, but they do need to interact with each other at some point, so all streams would need to be subscribed to, but muted as there’s a lot of chatter the teams do. Everything is categorized like above, announcements, discussion, development, bugs, so on. So the list for each team is about 4 or more streams.

I hope the above will generate some discussion on how to organize the stream list. :)

Many annotations in zerver/lib/cache.py, zerver/lib/cache_helpers.py and zerver/models.py were wrong. So I first fixed them. I have made this PR now so that that work can be reviewed.

I have also added a `zerver/lib/text_utils.py`. This is inspired from [django.utils.encoding](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/utils/#module-django.utils.encoding).

Some of the intermediate commits don't pass mypy checks, but I couldn't figure out a way to split my commits otherwise. All commits pass tools/test-backend.

zerver/lib/cache.py had a lot of wrong annotations. I fixed as many as I could find. But that produced other mypy errors. When I tried to fix them, I got other mypy errors. This chain continued for some time until I hit a few places where `bytes` were being used (like zlib.compress and decompress in zerver/models.py). Those had bugs which prevented me from annotating some functions correctly, so I had to fix them.

I suspect the issue is caused by the frontend markdown processor (used to echo messages sent by the user quickly) doesn't properly color the message red.

Fixing this likely involves some changes in echo.js, specifically `handleUserMentions`.

I had made tools/lint-all compatible with python 3 in #833 and it did help find some python 3 errors then. I fixed those as part of #833.

Today (c9bb93b) I again ran tools/lint-all in python 3 and it showed this error:

```

```

This was introduced in 654bd66.

This is invalid syntax in python 3 because of https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0414/#exclusion-of-raw-unicode-literals

I think we should add `tools/lint-all` in python 3 mode to Travis. It will help prevent such errors in the future. Since our code is not python 3 compatible, we might face some hard-to-fix errors if we are very unlucky. But that won't be a big problem since the erroneous file can be added to the exclude list in such a case.

883,The tutorial causes multiple notification permission panels in Safari.,"**SUMMARY**
After a user walks through the tutorial, they will be presented with Safari's Notification Center permission panel once for every step in the tutorial (currently five).

**EXPECTED BEHAVIOR**
The user should only see the permission panel once.

**REPRO**
For a server you have never logged in to before:
- Login to a new account to enable the tutorial.
- Click through the tutorial.
- Safari will present the notifications permission panel once for each step of the demo.

If you have previously gone through the tutorial and answered the Safari notification permissions panel, you will need to first run these steps:
- Open the Safari preferences (Safari menu -> Preferences).
- Click on the Notifications tab.
- Find the server you will log in to (usually ""localhost"" for the dev server).
- Select it and click the Remove button in the lower left.
- Create a new user with which to login and walk through the tutorial.
- [WARNING] Alternatively, from the zulip directory, run `./tools/do-destroy-rebuild-database` to destroy your database and start with the defaults.  This will destroy all existing data in the database.

**VERSIONS AFFECTED**
- Safari 9.1.1 (11601.6.17)
- Safari Technology Preview 9.1.1 (11601.6.17, 11602.1.33)

**NOTES**
- If you remove the Zulip server from Safari’s Notification Center preferences after clicking through any of the tutorial (for example, after the first four steps), Safari will still present notification permission panels for each step in the tutorial.
- Firefox and Chrome, which use custom notification frameworks and not the native Notification Center, do not have this problem.
- If you remove your server from the Safari’s notification preferences after the tutorial, reload the page, and click on the website, you will see one notification permission panel (the expected behavior).
- Only the first answer matters.  If the user selects Allow and then selects Deny on the subsequent panels, their preference will still be set to Allow. (This is a Safari bug.)

Zulip dev still runs when this is the case, but shared folders aren't synchronized except on vagrant up/reload. This makes development a cumbersome process.

Possible solutions:
- Modify vagrantfile to update virtualbox guest additions as needed, uninstall old packages and installing iso[1] manually.
- Use vagrant plugin[2] to update virtualbox guest additions as needed.
- Specify that developers use VirtualBox 4.3.x[3]

I think a good place to start would be zerver/models.py, zerver/views/, zerver/lib/actions.py, since those are in some ways the most important files in the project.  Once we have those fully annotated to our satisfaction, we can start working through the rest of the project.

Strategically, the goal should be to avoid using `type: Any` or `type: ignore` in these annotations when possible; when we do use one of those annotations, we should use a comment in the annotation linking to the relevant mypy bug or otherwise explaining why we were unable to fully describe the type of the relevant function.

725,Clear most files from the mypy exclude list,"Now that we have mypy running in Travis CI, it'd be great to narrow down the list of files that we can't run it on.  

There's a range of problems and likely different things we'll need to do for each. In 755695d3c0062dff3685fd5153f1c752d02c3f67 and its parent I pushed fixed for a couple problems affecting a large fraction of files; here are some notes on some of the other issues:
- Several items are bugs that I've reported in https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/created_by/timabbott but haven't been fixed yet.  @sharmaeklavya2 you'll probably want to read all of those open issues (and maybe even the closed ones) to get a flavor of how we've been doing bug reports as well as what known issues we've seen in the Zulip codebase there are.  E.g. the LooseVersion issue that we have in `api/zulip/__init__.py`.  For those, it's reasonable to use a `type: ignore`.  I'm a fan of tagged those with a comment linking back to the relevant mypy bug, e.g.: `# type: ignore # https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/1165`.  That way, when the mypy bug is fixed, it's easy to know which`# type: ignore`s we can remove.
- `zerver/lib/upload.py:69: error: Exception must be derived from BaseException`: I think this is probably a mypy bug that it isn't able to infer that we are inheriting from BaseException via Exception and JsonableError.  This would be a good candidate for reporting a bug in mypy.
- api/integrations/: we have a lot of use of `value = None` defaults in the integration config files; I'm not excited about adding type annotations to those files since it's kinda user-facing, so we may just want to leave those as-is.  But it might be reasonable to report a mypy issue that it shouldn't throw errors when
- zerver/lib/actions.py: This one seems like it might be an issue with how 
- A lot of the directories, like zproject/, only some of the files are problematic; it'd be good to only list the files that have issues.

622,Add management command to test sending email,"A common issue when setting up Zulip in production is issues with setting up email sending.  For LDAP, we have a nice management command that the user can run iteratively until the LDAP integration is working; we should do the same for testing that outgoing email works.  (the current workflow involves the user debugging on the login form and checking logs, which means a lot of users get the negative early experience of seeing errors trying to login, when they really shouldn't have to).

It'd be great to add a similar management command for testing sending email.  I think this may be possible to do this by just taking the default Django email sending code here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/email/ and adding appropriate command-line flags to make it easy to test.

611,Migrate remaining web-only routes to be API routes,"We have an ongoing migration to move routes from the `urlpatterns += patterns('zerver.views',` section of zproject/urls.py, which are only available via the web, to be REST API-accessible (the routes in the same file that all use `rest_dispatch`) and not duplicated (we have some functions available via both interfaces right now).  We don't need to move every route (e.g. the `json/report_send_time` type logging routes can stay web-only), but ideally everything that makes sense in the REST API should be available there and no longer appear in the old JSON style route maps.

In other cases, e.g. `json/subscriptions/exists`, we'd need to add a new `HEAD users/me/subscriptions` route to cover the use case.

Moving a few routes can be a great project for new contributors to get familiar with how the codebase is setup, since it generally only takes.

If you work on this, please do it with commits that are easy to read/review, e.g. moving a single route per commit, and please check carefully (e.g. using grep) that you've eliminate all references to the old route, since it's very common for bugs to be introduced in this sort of refactoring.

610,Clean up legacy global variables in Zulip javascript,"The Zulip web codebase has an ongoing (and mostly complete) migration in process to eliminate global variables and replace them with calls into well-defined modules.

You can see our current list of globals in the sections of check-all.js that aren't lists of modules:

```
    // index.html
    + ' page_params'

    // common.js
    + ' status_classes password_quality'

    // setup.js
    + ' csrf_token'

    // zulip.js
    + ' all_msg_list home_msg_list narrowed_msg_list current_msg_list'
    + ' keep_pointer_in_view unread_messages_read_in_narrow'
    + ' respond_to_message recenter_view last_viewport_movement_direction'
    + ' scroll_to_selected get_private_message_recipient'
    + ' viewport process_loaded_for_unread'
    + ' have_scrolled_away_from_top'
    + ' maybe_scroll_to_selected recenter_pointer_on_display suppress_scroll_pointer_update'
    + ' fast_forward_pointer recent_subjects unread_subjects'
    + ' furthest_read server_furthest_read'
```

To clean one of these up, we basically just need to move the relevant functions/variables into either an existing module or a new one.  A good place to start for anyone interested would probably be the globals with `unread` in their name (except process_loaded_for_unread which is badly named) which should be moved into unread.js or moving the pointer-related code into a new pointer.js module; I'm happy to post more thoughts/details on how to do this if there's interest.

If you work on this, please do it with commits that are easy to read/review, e.g. moving a single function per commit, and please check carefully (e.g. using `grep`) that you've eliminate all references to the old identifier.  It's very common for bugs to be introduced in this sort of refactoring.

538,"APNS package is out of date, causes authentication error","Zulip currently relies on the [**apnsclient** package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/apns-client/0.2.1) for sending Apple push notifications.  Unfortunately, that package hasn't been actively maintained since 2014.

This has become a problem as **apnsclient** still uses `OpenSSL.SSL.SSLv3_METHOD`, which Apple stopped supporting in October of 2014.  As such, if you build the current Zulip as-is, Apple will reject your attempts to send push notifications.

The simple solution (aka no changes to the Zulip code base) is to edit the apns.py file within the **apnsclient** directory directly, changing:

`self._context = OpenSSL.SSL.Context(OpenSSL.SSL.SSLv3_METHOD)`

to 

`self._context = OpenSSL.SSL.Context(OpenSSL.SSL.TLSv1_METHOD)`

**_Longer term_**, we should consider replacing the apnsclient package with a more supported version and updating the methods in `/zerver/lib/push_notifications.py`

Then when I ran `./tools/test-backend`, it passed all tests.

After that I ran `./tools/test-js-with-casper` and it failed. Then I again tried `./tools/test-backend` and it failed with the same error message as above.

The moral: When Casper tests fail, they also cause the backend tests to fail. This is not right behavior in my opinion (i.e. a bug).

@lfaraone suggests that the reason this happens is because test-backend doesn't clear out the database, so its possible to be left with unexpected database state. Perhaps we should have all test runners flush the database before starting. (Although the ordering for test-all should ensure that the database is cleared and things are then run in proper order.)

Simply installing phantomjs using apt-get is not guaranteed to work, since Zulip depends on a specific version ([1.9.8](https://bitbucket.org/ariya/phantomjs/downloads/phantomjs-1.9.8-linux-x86_64.tar.bz2)) of phantomjs. The version in Ubuntu 15.10's repositories is currently 1.9.0.

According to @timabbott, probably the right solution is to factor out the code in provision.py that installs phantomjs into a script, and then call that script in provision.py as well as in the list of by-hand commands.

This adds a working Dockerfile and my `create-admin-user.sh` script.

I included the `docker-compose.yml` because the database server needs to be my `galexrt/zulip-postgresql-tsearchextras` (because other postgresql images don't have the tsearch extension installed). You would just need to change the image names (example `zulip/zulip:1.3.10`).

If there is anything that can improve this Pull Request, please let me know.

---

Original commit messages:

```
This adds a working Dockerfile for ""production"" use
It includes a `docker-compose.yml` which currently uses my image.
The `docker-entrypoint.sh` is about 285 lines of code, but it has inbuilt database backup and restore function.
(I can remove the backup and restore or add more functions see https://github.com/galexrt/docker-zulip)

I also added an README.docker.md, it should give users a quick start on how to use the docker image.

Added Dockerfile for ""production"" use
Added other docker related files like docker-compose.yml and docker-entrypoint.sh

Added the generate secrets command to the entrypoint

puppet: Move several debugging tool dependencies out of base.pp.

Rename zulip::postgres_appdb to zulip::postgres_appdb_base.

The purpose of this rename is to allow us to move the postgres-related
configuration out of voyager.pp.

puppet: Move tuned postgres configuration out of voyager.pp.

This should make it easier for someone to run just the tuned Zulip
database on one server and the Zulip frontend on another.

puppet: Move prod-static creation from voyager.pp to app_frontend.pp.

Every app frontend will need this directory and this should help
enable more modular puppet rules.

puppet: Move Zulip apt repository to its own manifest.

puppet: Rename app_frontend.pp to app_frontend_base.pp.

This will enable us to move the remaining app-frontend related content
out of voyager.pp.

puppet: Move memcached into its own puppet module.

puppet: Move memcached and rabbitmq include out of app_frontend_base.pp.

puppet: Move default nginx configuration out of voyager.pp.

Document the puppet configuration somewhat in zulip::voyager.

puppet: Make apt repository conditional on the Ubuntu version.

We still will need to address this in the install script as well.

puppet: Use a variable to configure the postgres version.

puppet: Use $postgres_version in postgres template.

This eliminates hardcoding of the postgres version from the Zulip
puppet configuration.

Fix missing puppet dependencies on postgres package.

Added ""custom"" dockervoyer puppet manifest

Add the files from the repo directly (dont use git clone to get something we already have in our docker build directory)

Added cron.conf for running cron inside the docker container
Useful for later docker related features like auto backup (see https://github.com/Galexrt/docker-zulip/blob/master/entrypoint.sh#L337-L345)

Filled .dockerignore with directories and fiels to ignore/exclude from the image builds

Fixed the linking of directories

Removed git package and don't add ""deb-src"" list

Fixed the settings path aka the zproject settings folder

Removed the ""removement"" of ""Service"" tasks thing puppet

Remove the puppet files after the puppet install

Removed the zproject directory from the $DATA_DIR
The zproject directory causes trouble if it is just linked. Because zulip uses paths like this for example ""deployments/../memcached_prefix"".

Removed a trailing slash

Wait for database to come online and create database and schema ""manually""
(Shouldn't occure because zulip needs the postgres tsearch thingy extensions, thus rendering every other postgresql image/server than the galexrt/zulip-postgresql-tsearchextras:latest)

Added the wait for database code

Fixed the rabbitmq connection problem

Use sed to replace the default memcached location with the env var MEMCACHED_LOCATION

Added the tsearch_extras extension query to the database (re)creation part

Migrate the database everytime we start (for safety)

Tweaks and fixes to the docker-entrypoint.sh

Restructured the entrypoint.sh

Restructured the docker-entrypoint.sh
This restructure adds database backup and restore functionality
Added ""Running in Docker"" to the README.md

Fixed the help text for the app:help function

Fixed the restore help line (was app:backup is now app:restore)
Added more explanation to the README.docker.md

Small adjustments and tweaks to the entrypoint.sh

We don't need to copy the uploads from the home/zulip

Added restart always to the docker-compose.yml (because there is no wait for container x to become ready)
Added Try counter at the migration

Tweaks and optimization for the entrypoint.sh

Renamed the zulipgeneratesecrets function

This could fix the exit code 0 problem

Fix for the retry at the database migration

Some changes to the sql queries

Small change to the queries
Fixed the if

Added the forgotten nginx.conf to supervisor
(It's a little bit embarassing, that forgot the main part of this container)

**Streams**
_<user>_ just created a new stream _<stream>_. `Subscribe to <stream>`

with the Subscribe being a button and changing to Unsubscribe afterwards if one is subscribed.

Now if that stream gets renamed or deleted later, the button still exists, and a click will actually create a new stream of the original name. IMO this is highly undesirable since it leads to loads of confusions like we had yesterday when someone created a stream with a typo, immediately asked an admin to rename it and all the sudden we had two streams when people kept klicking on the button in the original announce message.

I have not had the time to go and try understand exactly where this ends up in the backend but maybe it is possible to simply turn off auto creation of streams upon subscribe.

417,tools/zulip-export/zulip-export not scalable,"I was looking at get_old_messages and noticed that the zulip/zulip-export script makes a remote api request hitting that endpoint with a potentially very large value for ""num_after"". Exporting a stream with a ton of messages (think 100K +) could take a very long time and may be open to DOS.

In particular, this is the code that calls _get_old_messages_ with potentially very large value of max_id.

``` python
queue = client.register(event_types=['message'])
client._register('get_old_messages', method='GET', url='messages')
max_id = queue['max_message_id']
messages = []
print ""Fetching messages...""
result = client.get_old_messages({'anchor': 0,
                                  'num_before': 0,
                                  'num_after': max_id,
                                  'narrow': [{'operator': 'stream',
                                             'operand': options.stream}],
                                  'apply_markdown': False})
```

My suggestion would be to loop and batch until there are no messages left - say a batch size of 1000 seems manageable. The data would be parsed & written to the json file in each iteration, avoiding potential memory error due to loading 1M records before writing.

The only down side I can think of would be potentially hitting the API Rate limit for streams with > 100K records.

Changing it to use batching would mean there's no need to fetch the ""max_message_id"" so this could could be removed:

``` python
queue = client.register(event_types=['message'])
max_id = queue['max_message_id']
```

I'm not too sure why add_subscription is called - doesn't this add the specified user to the stream, which seems a bit odd? Would be nice to remove for if possible:

``` python
client.add_subscriptions([{""name"": options.stream}])
```

BTW, I have most of the changes ready locally, though my companies IP folks have yet to sign the CLA. It's looking like that will be on the week of Jan 18.

Would be interested in feedback before potentially submitting a pull request in about 1 week's time...

PS. I also have code to enforce a maximum value for ""num_before"" & ""num_after"" so that malicious/buggy client cannot take down the server with the get_old_messages endpoint. But need to resolve this export code, since the restriction would otherwise break it.

374,Users with same display name breaks @-mention,"It's possible for people to have the same display name, while having different email addresses. This becomes more likely in larger companies.

For example:
- John Doe (john.doe@company.domain)
- John Doe (john.doe2@company.domain)

@-mentioning @**John Doe** has unpredictable results. This is because display name is used to match the name:

https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/e95739961f28916011d36fe58cc4eb45a20e20a3/zerver/lib/bugdown/__init__.py#L794

``` python
        user = db_data['full_names'].get(name.lower(), None)
        if user is None:
            user = db_data['short_names'].get(name.lower(), None)
```

Since display name is not a unique attribute it would be much better to use the email address to identify the user as part of the send_message UI & API.

360,Clear user filter after pressing enter,"Hi,
Thanks for the great product.  I have a workflow suggestion, which I'm hoping will be a quick no-brainer.

A common workflow for sending a private message is the following:
1. press `esc` to clear the compose box
2. press `q` to go to the USERS filter
3. type the first letters of a user's name
4. press enter to open the compose box
5. type and send a message to the user

The end result of this is that the partial user name from step 3 is still in the USERS filter.  That's bad for two reasons: 1) I can't see who's online because it only shows that one user, and 2) the next time that I try to send a private message I have to delete the previous filter, which slows me down.  It would be better to clear the filter after pressing enter.  For example, this is how Pidgin works.  I can't think of a very good reason to leave it there.

224,Install Script Stalls with 'OK' and no progress for long time,"I am trying to install Zulip in [C1 instance of Scaleway.com](https://www.scaleway.com/faq/server/) ARM based servers. I followed the instructions from https://zulip.org/server.html

When I execute the

>    ./script/setup/install

the script installed the dependencies. I don't see any errors being thrown out anywhere, but one `warning` at one place nevertheless the script execution continues

>    Warning: Config file /etc/puppet/hiera.yaml not found, using Hiera defaults

Finally the script has stalled with 'OK' message after executing flush-memcached. I have stopped the script manually after waiting for more than an hour and executed the script again which brings me to the same situation again.

> sudo rabbitmqctl add_user zulip e3f1444da78409df413688c8c33bb62adbe128a37c2804a8a169e24958cda767

No progress from here, the script never ends or doesn't throw any feedback.

208,Make Zulip server upgrade process less error-prone,"Hi there

This could just be my stupidity, or inablility to follow instructions properly.

I'm working on the instructions here: https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/master/README.prod.md under the section ""Maintaining Zulip in Production"".

I'm stuck on almost the first step. I have downloaded the new version:

```

```

No problem there. Then changed the owner to zulip, and the permissions to 777. (just in case - because literally following the instructions failed with the same error first time around)

```
-rwxrwxrwx  1 zulip root 28713259 Oct 20 07:28 zulip-server-1.3.7.tar.gz*
```

Then I started the upgrade and it fell over instantly:

```

It pretends to be a permissions issue, but.. I'm root?!

162,"python-ujson missing on Trusty i386 (""No module named ujson"")","While installing Zulip on a Ubuntu 14.04 Server VM, `scripts/setup/install` gave the following error (buried in the middle of the output; it was willing to continue in spite of this): 

```

When I tried to run `initialize-database`, it gave the following output:

```

This was easily fixed by running `apt-get install python-pip libpython2.7-dev; pip install ujson`, but it would obviously be better if the `python-ujson` package were properly available. It might also be better if the setup script were more thorough about error checking (or if Zulip were a traditional .deb package that could declare its own dependencies - but that's a whole other can of worms).

153,Changes to EXTERNAL_HOST not applied to password reset emails,"Reproduction steps:
1. Deploy zulip server on temp-hostname.example.com
2. Create some users
3. Change EXTERNAL_HOST to zulip.example.com in the /etc/zulip/settings.py & restart zulip server
4. Have a user use the ""forgot password"" link.

Expected:

The email contains a https://zulip.example.com link

Actual:

The email contains a https://temp-hostname.example.com link

Analysis:

When the zulip server is initially configured, initialise_voyager_db.py copies the EXTERNAL_HOST to site.domain (presumably stored in the database)
The email template for password resets contains:

```
It's all good. Follow the link below and we'll take care of the rest:
    <{{ protocol}}://{{ domain }}{% url 'django.contrib.auth.views.password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}>
```

Whereas the other email templates in templates/zerver/emails are using EXTERNAL_HOST, e.g.

```
Click here to log in to Zulip and catch up: https://{{ external_host }}.
```

I've not yet investigated what else uses site.domain, or if this difference is required for multi-realm (zulip.com) installations.

While convenient for building voyager tarballs, for Debian packaging I need the unminified upstream source. It'd also be a lot nicer if `tools` was included in that source distribution, so I don't need to vendor the build scripts in `debian/`.

We could solve this by amending `.gitattributes` then specifying a different blacklist for our ""binary"" release tarballs.

73,Document how to configure the S3 file upload integration,"I think the process is roughly like this:

Check out the S3-related configuration in zproject/local_settings.py (the config for zulip.com).  You'll want to copy into your /etc/zulip/settings.py something like these lines:

S3_AUTH_UPLOADS_BUCKET = ""zulip-user-uploads""  
S3_AVATAR_BUCKET=""humbug-user-avatars""                                                                              

And then you'll also want to popular the s3_key and s3_secret_key fields in /etc/zulip/zulip-secrets.conf to configure your S3 access key and secret key.

Once that's done, when you upload a file using Zulip it should be stored in S3_AUTH_UPLOADS_BUCKET (and new avatars that are set go into S3_AVATAR_BUCKET).

72,Can't login using LDAP,"I installed zulip server following the instructions in zulip.org; I edited the /etc/zulip/settings.py file but I cant login using LDAP.

In the commented examples for auth backends there's no example for using LDAP, I found in a reddit comment that the backend should be:
'zproject.backends.ZulipLDAPAuthBackend'

Adding that to the authentications backends, restartint the server (even running the puppet receipe) doesn't seems to help. Nothing happens when I click on ""Log In"", nor error in the logs neither.

What is the proper way to enable LDAP Authentication?

23,Puppet tries to connect to remote server,"There are some issues with how you are using Puppet.

The /etc/puppet/puppet.conf you are dropping on the system contains:

```
[main]
server = puppet.zulip.com
```

As Ubuntu automatically starts the puppet agent after the package is installed (via your install script) all servers will try to connect to puppet.zulip.com.
Thankfully that server does not exist but it is a serious security risk.
If someone were to setup a server at that address he could control all servers which installed via that install script.

Also, it is nowhere mentioned that you shouldn't run the installer on a system which is already running Puppet.
The installer will overwrite your /etc/puppet/puppet.conf and break your setup.

In my opinion you shouldn't replace the puppet.conf at all.
As far as I can tell you are using `puppet apply ...` and you should be able to specify all options directly there.
