"""
Implements the per-domain data retention policy.

The goal is to have a single place where the policy is defined.  This is
complicated by needing to apply this policy both to the database and to log
files.  Additionally, we want to use an efficient query for the database,
rather than iterating through messages one by one.

The code in this module does not actually remove anything; it just identifies
which items should be kept or removed.
