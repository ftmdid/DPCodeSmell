# Most people find that having every change in Trac result in a
# notification is too noisy -- in particular, when someone goes
# through recategorizing a bunch of tickets, that can often be noisy
# and annoying.  We solve this issue by only sending a notification if
# one of the more important fields is changed or the person making the
# change makes a comment.
#
# Total list of fields is:
# (priority, milestone, cc, owner, keywords, component, severity,
#  type, versions, description, resolution, summary)
#
# The following is the list of fields which can be changed without
# triggering a Humbug notification
TRAC_NOTIFY_FIELDS = ["description", "summary", "resolution"]

## If properly installed, the Humbug API should be in your import
## path, but if not, set a custom path below
HUMBUG_API_PATH = "/home/humbug/humbug/api"

# This should not need to change unless you have a custom Humbug subdomain.
