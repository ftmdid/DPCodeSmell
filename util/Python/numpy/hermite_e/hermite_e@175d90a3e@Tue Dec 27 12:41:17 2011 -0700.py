dealing with Hermite_e series, including a `HermiteE` class that

    in HermiteE form, where the `r_n` are the roots specified in `roots`.
    If a zero has multiplicity n, then it must appear in `roots` n times.
    For instance, if 2 is a root of multiplicity three and 3 is a root of
    multiplicity 2, then `roots` looks something like [2, 2, 2, 3, 3]. The
    roots can appear in any order.

    """
    Integrate a Hermite_e series.

    Returns the Hermite_e series coefficients `c` integrated `m` times from
    `lbnd` along `axis`. At each iteration the resulting series is
    **multiplied** by `scl` and an integration constant, `k`, is added.
    The scaling factor is for use in a linear change of variable.  ("Buyer
    beware": note that, depending on what one is doing, one may want `scl`
    to be the reciprocal of what one might expect; for more information,
    see the Notes section below.)  The argument `c` is an array of
    coefficients from low to high degree along each axix, e.g., [1,2,3]
    represents the series ``H_0 + 2*H_1 + 3*H_2`` while [[1,2],[1,2]]
    represents ``1*H_0(x)*H_0(y) + 1*H_1(x)*H_0(y) + 2*H_0(x)*H_1(y) +
    2*H_1(x)*H_1(y)`` if axis=0 is ``x`` and axis=1 is ``y``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        Array of Hermite_e series coefficients. If c is multidimensional
        the different axis correspond to different variables with the
        degree in each axis given by the corresponding index.
    m : int, optional
        Order of integration, must be positive. (Default: 1)
    k : {[], list, scalar}, optional
        Integration constant(s).  The value of the first integral at
        ``lbnd`` is the first value in the list, the value of the second
        integral at ``lbnd`` is the second value, etc.  If ``k == []`` (the
        default), all constants are set to zero.  If ``m == 1``, a single
        scalar can be given instead of a list.
    lbnd : scalar, optional
        The lower bound of the integral. (Default: 0)
    scl : scalar, optional
        Following each integration the result is *multiplied* by `scl`
        before the integration constant is added. (Default: 1)
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which the derivative is taken. (Default: 0).

    Returns
    -------
    S : ndarray
        Hermite_e series coefficients of the integral.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``m < 0``, ``len(k) > m``, ``np.isscalar(lbnd) == False``, or
        ``np.isscalar(scl) == False``.

    --------
    hermeder

    Notes
    -----
    Note that the result of each integration is *multiplied* by `scl`.
    Why is this important to note?  Say one is making a linear change of
    variable :math:`u = ax + b` in an integral relative to `x`.  Then
    .. math::`dx = du/a`, so one will need to set `scl` equal to
    :math:`1/a` - perhaps not what one would have first thought.

    Also note that, in general, the result of integrating a C-series needs
    to be "re-projected" onto the C-series basis set.  Thus, typically,
    the result of this function is "un-intuitive," albeit correct; see
    Examples section below.

    If `c` is a 1-D array, then `p(x)` will have the same shape as `x`.  If
    `c` is multidimensional, then the shape of the result depends on the
    value of `tensor`. If `tensor` is true the shape will be c.shape[1:] +

        dimensional case the coefficients may be thought of as stored in
        the columns of `c`.
    tensor : boolean, optional
        If True, the shape of the coefficient array is extended with ones
        on the right, one for each dimension of `x`. Scalars have dimension 0
        for this action. The result is that every column of coefficients in
        `c` is evaluated for every element of `x`. If False, `x` is broadcast

    Returns the pseudo Vandermonde matrix for 3D Hermite_e series in `x`,

    after conversion to arrays and the dtype will be converted to either
    float64 or complex128 depending on whether any of `x`, `y`, or 'z' are
    complex.  The maximum degrees of the 3D Hermite_e series in each
    variable are specified in the list `deg` in the form ``[xdeg, ydeg,
    zdeg]``. The return array has the shape ``x.shape + (order,)`` if `x`,

    is the number of elements in a flattened coefficient array of original

    squares fits.

    Parameters

    """
    Least squares fit of Hermite series to data.

    Fit a Hermite series ``p(x) = p[0] * P_{0}(x) + ... + p[deg] *
    P_{deg}(x)`` of degree `deg` to points `(x, y)`. Returns a vector of
    coefficients `p` that minimises the squared error.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, shape (M,)
        x-coordinates of the M sample points ``(x[i], y[i])``.
    y : array_like, shape (M,) or (M, K)
        y-coordinates of the sample points. Several data sets of sample
        points sharing the same x-coordinates can be fitted at once by
        passing in a 2D-array that contains one dataset per column.
    deg : int
        Degree of the fitting polynomial
    rcond : float, optional
        Relative condition number of the fit. Singular values smaller than
        this relative to the largest singular value will be ignored. The
        default value is len(x)*eps, where eps is the relative precision of
        the float type, about 2e-16 in most cases.
    full : bool, optional
        Switch determining nature of return value. When it is False (the
        default) just the coefficients are returned, when True diagnostic
        information from the singular value decomposition is also returned.
    w : array_like, shape (`M`,), optional
        Weights. If not None, the contribution of each point
        ``(x[i],y[i])`` to the fit is weighted by `w[i]`. Ideally the
        weights are chosen so that the errors of the products ``w[i]*y[i]``
        all have the same variance.  The default value is None.

    Returns
    -------
    coef : ndarray, shape (M,) or (M, K)
        Hermite coefficients ordered from low to high. If `y` was 2-D,
        the coefficients for the data in column k  of `y` are in column
        `k`.

    [residuals, rank, singular_values, rcond] : present when `full` = True
        Residuals of the least-squares fit, the effective rank of the
        scaled Vandermonde matrix and its singular values, and the
        specified value of `rcond`. For more details, see `linalg.lstsq`.

    Warns
    -----
    RankWarning
        The rank of the coefficient matrix in the least-squares fit is
        deficient. The warning is only raised if `full` = False.  The
        warnings can be turned off by

        >>> import warnings
        >>> warnings.simplefilter('ignore', RankWarning)

    scipy.interpolate.UnivariateSpline : Computes spline fits.

    Notes
    -----
    The solution are the coefficients ``c[i]`` of the Hermite series
    ``P(x)`` that minimizes the squared error

    ``E = \\sum_j |y_j - P(x_j)|^2``.

    This problem is solved by setting up as the overdetermined matrix
    equation

    ``V(x)*c = y``,

    where ``V`` is the Vandermonde matrix of `x`, the elements of ``c`` are
    the coefficients to be solved for, and the elements of `y` are the
    observed values.  This equation is then solved using the singular value
    decomposition of ``V``.

    If some of the singular values of ``V`` are so small that they are
    neglected, then a `RankWarning` will be issued. This means that the
    coeficient values may be poorly determined. Using a lower order fit
    will usually get rid of the warning.  The `rcond` parameter can also be
    set to a value smaller than its default, but the resulting fit may be
    spurious and have large contributions from roundoff error.

    Fits using Hermite series are usually better conditioned than fits
    using power series, but much can depend on the distribution of the
    sample points and the smoothness of the data. If the quality of the fit
    is inadequate splines may be a good alternative.

    Notes
    -----
    The root estimates are obtained as the eigenvalues of the companion
    matrix, Roots far from the origin of the complex plane may have large
    errors due to the numerical instability of the series for such
    values. Roots with multiplicity greater than 1 will also show larger
    errors as the value of the series near such points is relatively
    insensitive to errors in the roots. Isolated roots near the origin can
    be improved by a few iterations of Newton's method.

    The HermiteE series basis polynomials aren't powers of `x` so the
    results of this function may seem unintuitive.
